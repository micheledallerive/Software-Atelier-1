               <h3>First Turing Award ever </h3>
               <p>In 1966, the first Turing award ever has made his appearance. Alan Perlis is known for being the person that received that first award,
                  according to the citation, "for his influence in the area
                  of advanced programming techniques and compiler construction." This quote refers mainly to his work on the <em>ALGOL</em> programming language,
                  as a member of the team that worked on it.
               </p>

               <h3> Importance of his contribute</h3>
               <p>As the quote says, Perlis's influence has been essential for the construction of compilers.
                 A compiler is a program that is able to translate a code from a programming language to another one (from the "source" language to the "target" language).
                 The first compiler in the history
                 was created by <a class="link" href="https://history-computer.com/grace-hopper-complete-biography" target="_blank">Grace Hopper</a>.
                 However, Perlis's work on this subject has been essential: in fact, as well as many others things,
                 in 1955 he build the IT compiler for the <em>Datatron 205</em> at Purdue University.
               </p>

               <p>One of the most important works of Perlis, however, is without any doubt the creation of the <em>ALGOL-60</em> programming language. In fact,
                 it is actually considered by someone one of the most influential programming languages in history. Indeed, it was really helpful to get a step
                 further in understanding and accepting "programming" as a legitimate object of study. In addition, Perlis worked hard to turn <em>ALGOL</em>
                 into a model for programming research: with his team, he added to it several extensions and publicly emphatized the importance and the potential
                 of programming languages and algorithms in computer science.
