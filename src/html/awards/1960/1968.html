               <h3>Why the Turing Award? </h3>
               <p> Richard Hamming is the third person in the world that received the prestigious
                 Turing Award. He is well known for the many implication that his work had on computer
                 engineering, such as the <em>Hamming code,</em> the <em>Hamming numbers </em>, the <em>Hamming window </em> and the
                 <em>Hamming distance</em>. In particular, the reason he won is "for his work on numerical methods,
                    automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes".
               </p>

               <h3>More on his work </h3>
               <h4> Hamming code </h4>
               <p> The <em>Hamming codes </em>are basically linear-correcting codes, that can detect one-bit and two-bit errors.
                 Hamming invented them in order to automatically correct errors introduced by punched cards readers (in fact,
                 they can also correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors). Before the invention of <em>
                 Hamming code </em>, there already were some simple error-detecting codes
                 (e.g. <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit" target="_blank">
                  parity bit </a>), but no one ever reached this efficiency before.
               </p>
               <h4>Hamming numbers </h4>
               <p>More generally called <em>Regular numbers </em>, the <em>Hamming numbers </em> are those numbers
                 that evenly divide powers of 60, and equivantly their only prime divisors are 2,3 and 5.
                </p>
                <p>In computer science they are known as <em>Hamming numbers </em> since Richard Hamming invented the
                <em>Hamming problem </em>, that consist in finding algorithms that could generate these numbers
                in ascending order.
               </p>
               <h4>Hamming distance </h4>
               <p>The <em>Hamming distance </em> is an important concept in terms of error detection and error correction. In practice, the <em>minimum Hamming distance </em>
                  is the minimum numbers of bits of a codeword that you should flip to obtain another determined codeword.
                  (E.g. if you have the codewords "000" and "111" the <em>Hamming distance </em> is 3, because you would
                  need to flip all the three bits of the first one to obtain the second one).
               </p>
