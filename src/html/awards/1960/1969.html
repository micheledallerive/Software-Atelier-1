               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Marvin Minsky </h2>
               <h3>Why the Turing Award? </h3>
                <p> Minsky's researches focused on the concept of <em>Artificial Intelligence </em>.
                 He is in fact considered worthy of receiving the Turing Award for
                "his central role in creating, shaping, promoting, and advancing the field of artificial intelligence". <br>
                His inventions were remarkable, and they were perceived as futuristic by people;
                among other things, he invented the <em>SNARC </em> (1951), the <em>Confocal Scanning Microscope </em> (1955),
                the <em>Serpentine Hydraulic Robot Arm </em> (1967) and the first <em>head-mounted graphical display </em> in history (1963).
                </p>
               <h3>More on his work </h3>
                <p> Minksy's work contributed a lot in theoretical and practical advances in artificial intelligence, as well as neural networks and
               cognitive psychology. </p>
               <h4><em>SNARC </em> </h4>
                <p> <em>SNARC </em> stands for "Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator".
                  it is the first self-learning <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" target="_blank">Neural Network Simulator</a>:
                  in fact, when "rewarded" it facilitated recently-used pathways. It was based on the reinforcement of simulated synaptic transmission coefficients.
                </p>

               <h4> <em>Confocal Scanning Microscope </em> </h4>
                <p>This machine's purpose is to increase the contrast and the optical resolution of a
                  <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrograph" target="_blank">micrograph</a>.
                  Moving the stage, it was possible to scan the illumination point in the focal plane. The invention
                  of Minsky became popular because of his unprecedented resolution and image clarity.
                </p>

               <h4> <em>Serpentine Hydraulic Robot Arm </em> </h4>
                <p> Also known as <em>Tentacle Arm </em> or <em>Minsky Arm </em>, this robotic arm had movement that
                  reminded the ones of an octopus, and it was designed
                  to be mounted on a wall and reach around obstacles; it could lift the weight corresponding to a person.
                  Today, the original one can be found in the <em>Boston Museum of Science</em>.
                </p>

               <h4> <em>Head-mounted graphical display </em> </h4>
                <p> The <em>Head-mounted display </em> (also HMD) is a device that is typically worn
                  on the head and has two small display optic, one in front on each eye. The first of these devices
                  was invented five years before the well-known <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_(virtual_reality)"
                  target="_blank">Sword of Damocles</a>, that was created in 1968.
