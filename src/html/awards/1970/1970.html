               <p>
                  In 1970 James Hardy Wilkinson received the A.M.Turing award for his invention of Numerical Analysis.
                  Wilkinson's numerical analysis, uses numerical approximation to solve problems in mathematical analysis. This area of computer science and mathematics uses algorithms to solve problems of continuous mathematics.<br>
                  Thanks to the current computing power, it is possible to use numerical analysis in a more complex way, managing to create detailed mathematical models.
                  Through numerical analysis it is possible to calculate ordinary differential equations, celestial mechanics, stochastic differential equations and numerical linear algebra of data analysis.<br>
                  Before modern powerful computer, people used to use hand interpolation formulas, by receiving data from printed tables.
                  With Numerical analysis is intended every aspects of numerical solution of a mathematical problems
                  from theoretical thinking to the specific methods required to solve a specific problem.
                  Every numerical alaysts specialize in specific subfields, they have perspectives and mathematical methods in common.
                  <h2 class="subtitle">Where is it used?</h2>
                  Numerical analysis is used extensively in engineering and physics, and today it is also used in the social sciences and medicine.
                  Nowadays it's mainly used to predict result in the revolutionary field of machine learning. It also finds place to solve integral and
                  differential equations.<br> Most mathematical model are obtained by differential, integral and ordinary differential equations.
                  It also help the calculation of transport and disposition of chemicals through the body, to estimate the ocean currents and to model combustion flow in a coal power plant.
