               <p>
                    In 1956, John McCarthy coined the term of "Artificial Intelligence" as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".
                    McCarthy also created a wide used programming language called LISP, that was at least initially mainly used by the AI community due to its power and flexability.
                    He received the A.M Turing Award in 1971 for his contributions to the newborn field of Artificial Intelligence.
                    His papers were about the relation between  Artifical Intelligence, reasoning, formalizing common sense and mathematical logic. He often also discusses about 
                    Artifical Intelligence and philosophy. <br><br>After he coined his definition of Artifical Intelligence in 1956, started the AI research in the world
                    with him included. He himself became one of the most famous researcher in this specific field.
                    At the Stanford University, worked for a project intended to build a self-driving car system. He produced many papers concerning robot free will and consciousness
                    and in these years worked a lot to design a programm that would have given to computers the ability to understand and imitate human common-sense decision-making.
