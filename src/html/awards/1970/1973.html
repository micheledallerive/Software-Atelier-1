               <p>
               Charles Bachman received the A.M.Turing award in 1973 for his contribution to database management system.
               He was a developer, analyst and architect and in career lasted more than 50 years, he managed to create many useful tools, in the database field.
               He was working in the General electrical company, as he with a small team of people invented the Integrated  Data StoreIDS, the first database managing system.<br>
               In 1963 Bachman developed the Integrated Data Store , and is known as one of the first database management system. This system was particularly important
               as it was the first random access database management system.<br><br>
               His IDS used a database language that was already existing in other programming languages. <br>
               This invention wasn't only used by his co-workes, but he used also to help other companies with this service.
               Furthermore, for his databases he used virtual memory instead of phisical memory in order to be able
               to store the same ammount of data and information in less space.
