               <p>
                 Knuth is known for being the author  of The Art of Computer programming, an important set of books that talks about algorithms and its analysis.<br>
                This collection of books is composed of  6 volumes,  published in 1968, at the beginning he wrote just 1 volume, but he realised it wasn’t enough to explain all he wanted to.<br>
                The first three books that Knuth published had an important impact and helped many people to build knowledge on these books.<br>
                In 1974 Knuth has taken the A. M. Turing award for a big contribution on the field of design of programming languages and analysis of algorithms, and particularly for his important contributions to “The Art of Computer Programming” thanks to his collection of books.<br>
                The collections of algorithms, technique and the most important theory in all the books served as an significant influence in the whole computer science.<br>
                Given the many awards received, all the work done in influencing computer science, and his ingenious ways to solve problems, Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms".
