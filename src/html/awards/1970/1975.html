               <p>
                 Herbert Alexander Simon has been an innovative thinker, he has become the father of the most important disciplines like artificial intelligence, elaboration of informations, problem solving and so onâ€¦<br>
                 The influence of Simon is highlighted by the important prizes received : the Turing prize (1975) of Association for Computing Machinery with the help of Allen Newell for making contributions to artificial intelligence and the treatment of the lists.<br>
                 He systematically analyzed the decision-making behavior of individuals within organizations. In particular, he highlighted that an individual rather than making optimal choices, makes satisfactory choices, both for the constraints carried out by organizations and for the limits imposed by the human cognitive system.<br>
                 Simon being a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, created with Newell the programs "Logic Theory Machine" and "General Problem Solver" (G.P.S.) in 1957. The G.P.S. was maybe the first attempt to separate the problem-solving strategy from information on the problems to be solved. Both programs were developed using the Information Processing Language (IPL) (1956) developed by Newell and Simon.
