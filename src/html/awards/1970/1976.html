               <p>
                 After finishing the PhD, Rabin was called from IBM to participate in a small group of young scientists, this is where Rabin and Dana Scott worked together to write the “Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem” that made them give the Turing award of 1976.<br>
                 The Automata theory began with Walter Pitts in 1943 with the  study of artificial neural networks.
                 Rabin and Scott did something different and used a  “computational model” also known as a finite state machine.
                 These machines move from different states to others paying attention to the transition rules and to the input.
                 Rabin and Scott considered the nondeterministic machine that has several  possible transitions out of each state.
                 The machine could basically, by taking an input symbol, replicate it and each machine will proceed on one of the transitions.<br>
                 This concept of “nondeterministic machine”  is really important because has really helped with the survey of lots of problems and still is a real inspiration for different and new work.
