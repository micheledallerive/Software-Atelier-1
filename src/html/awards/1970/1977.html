               <p>
                 To help the programming difficulties of old calculators, in 1954 started a research project for IBM for the realisation of a programming language closer to a mathematical notation.
                 The result of the project will then become <b>“FORTRAN”</b>, the first programming language of high level that had a great impact, also commercial, on the whole community of informatics.<br>
                 After the realisation of FORTRAN , Backus has become an important member of the project specialized in the programming language ALGOL. In that context Backus proposed a new notation called <b>BNF</b> for the representation of the grammars used in the definition of a programming language.<br>

                 In the 70’s Backus focused on functional programming, planning the programming language <b>FP</b>.
                 His entire work on this, made functional programming a lot more accessible and started and important renaissance in research of the argument.<br>

               <p>In 1977 John Backus received the A.M. Turing award “For profound, influential, and lasting contributions to the design of practical high-level programming systems, notably through his work on FORTRAN, and for seminal publication of formal procedures for the specification of programming languages.” ~By anonymous speaker.</p>
