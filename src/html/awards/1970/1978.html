               <p>Robert W.Floyd won the Turing Award in 1978 for having a significant impact on the paradigms of programming
                for developing efficient and reliable software, as well as for helping to establish the following subfields of computer
                science: the theory of parsing, programming languages semantics, automated program verification, and automatic
                program synthesis.</p>
                <h3> The Paradigms of Programming</h3>
                <p>
                Professor Floyd explains, during his 1978 ACM Turing Award Lecture,
                how he thinks <b>The Paradigms of Programming</b> affect the success of a designer
                of computer programs, including how they should be taught and how they should
                be embodied in programming languages.
                Professor Rober illustrates that the state of computer programming,
                during the software crisis of the 1960 and after,
                is reflected in the deficiencies in the stock of paradigms,
                in the understanding of existing paradigms, how programming paradigms is taught,
                and how the then-current programming languages support or fail to support,
                the paradigms of their user communities.
                Therefore he advices to serious programmers that they need to invest a part
                of their working day studying and improving their methods. Despite the
                fact programmers are constantly pressed for time with the deadlines, since
                methodological abstraction is a long term investment.</p>
                <p>
To the teacher of programming, even more, I say:
identify the paradigms you use, as fully as you can, then
teach them explicitly. They will serve your students when
Fortran has replaced Latin and Sanskrit as the archetypal dead language.</p>
<p>To the designer of programming languages, I say:
unless you can support the paradigms I use when I
program, or at least support my extending your language
into one that does support my programming methods, I
don't need your shiny new languages; like an old car or
house, the old language has limitations I have learned to
live with. To persuade me of the merit of your language,
you must show me how to construct programs in it. I
don't want to discourage the design of new languages; I
want to encourage the language designer to become a
serious student of the details of the design process.</p>
