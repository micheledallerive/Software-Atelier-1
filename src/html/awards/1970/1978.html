               <p>Robert W.Floyd won the Turing Award in 1978 for having a significant impact on the paradigms of programming
                for developing efficient and reliable software, as well as for helping to establish the following subfields of computer
                science: the theory of parsing, programming languages semantics, automated program verification, and automatic
                program synthesis.</p>
                <h3> The Paradigms of Programming</h3>
                <p>
                Professor Floyd explains, during his 1978 ACM Turing Award Lecture,
                how he thinks <b>The Paradigms of Programming</b> affect the success of a designer
                of computer programs, including how they should be taught and how they should
                be embodied in programming languages.
                Professor Rober illustrates that the state of computer programming,
                during the software crisis of the 1960 and after,
                is reflected in the deficiencies in the stock of paradigms,
                in the understanding of existing paradigms, how programming paradigms is taught,
                and how the then-current programming languages support or fail to support,
                the paradigms of their user communities.
                Therefore he advises to serious programmers that they need to invest a part
                of their working day studying and improving their methods. Despite the
                fact, programmers are constantly pressed for time with the deadlines
                methodological abstraction is a long term investment.</p>
                <p>
                He also suggests even more to the programming teacher to identify
                the paradigms that they employ as thoroughly as possible, then teach them openly.
                As a result, students who have been explicitly taught a set of systematic
                approaches for all stages of program design will have a significant advantage
                over students who have been educated just via the study of completed programs.</p>
               <p>Instead, programming language designers should demonstrate
                 how to write programs in your language to persuade me of its worth.
                 Since the design of a language should be preceded by the enumeration of those paradigms,
                 as well as a study of the programming shortcomings produced.
