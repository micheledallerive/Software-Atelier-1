                 <blockquote cite="http://https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/iverson_9147499.cfm">
                For his pioneering effort in programming languages and mathematical notation resulting
                in what the computing field now knows as APL, for his contributions to the implementation of interactive systems,
                 to educational uses of APL, and to programming language theory and practice.

                  <h3>A Programming Language (APL)</h3>
                  <ul>
                  <li>APL is A Programming Language that comes from Kenneth books <q>A Programming Language</q> that uses a special set of characters in order to represent some high-level math operation.</li>
                  <li>It's really powerful for numerical processing since it has a large number of primitives, that are dedicated to controlling some vectors and matrices. Therefore by then, it was one of the most important application
                  for computers.</li>
                  <li>APL programs are very compact due to the power of the operators. This allows algorithms to be concentrated and avoid
                  the dispersion of the solution that the typical traditional programming languages had.</li>
                  <li>  APL also had been successful in commercial applications and he also created a
                  new basic executable notation that was more ideal for teaching and would be inexpensive.
                  They could run on a broad range of computing platforms while maintaining the language's simplicity and universality.</li>
                  </ul>
