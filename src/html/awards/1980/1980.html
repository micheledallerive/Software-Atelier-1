               <p>
                Tony Haore was a british computer scientist and in 1980 received the A.M.Turing Award for his research and contribution in programming language definition and design.
                After his graudation, worked for a small british company called Elliott Brothers and with a small team, worked to produce the ALGOL 60 compiler for the Elliott 503 computer.<br><br>
                <h2 class="subtitle">
                   His accomplishments
               </h2>
                For many, his best publication might be "Hints on programming language design" published in 1973, where he offers good advices to be able to write a solid programm. 
                He then created the creator of the "Hoaore Logic" and is able to help developers and engineers by check the "correctness" of a code.<br>
                One of his most important creation is Quicksort, a sorting algorithm that has been studied from Hoare for years
                In 1960, was researching about machine translation of languages and developed one of the most important sorting algorithms, the transputer machine architecture.<br>
                After his retirement from Oxford University, he entered Microsoft research as a researcher and developed many theories focused on different programming languages.
