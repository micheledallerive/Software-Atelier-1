               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Edgar F. Codd</h2>
               <p>
                 Codd worked on high position ways for software specification when he was at IBM Poughkeepsie where he  started  focusing on database issues.
                 Several database products did exist at that time, they were without exception ad hoc, clumsy, and delicate to use (they could really only be used by people having largely specialized knowledge) .
               </p>
               <h2 class="subtitle">Revolution</h2>
               <p>
                 The relational model is extensively honored as one of the great specialized achievements of the last century. It revolutionized the way databases were recognized; it converted the entire database field (which preliminarily was a little further than a collection of specific products and specialized techniques) into a scientific discipline. More specifically, it handed a theoretical framework in which a variety of important database problems could be addressed in a scientific way. As a consequence, it's not exaggerated to say that basically all databases in use or that are being developed now, are grounded on Codd’s ideas.<br> Whenever anyone uses an ATM machine, or uses a credit card, or purchases an airline ticket, he’s effectively counting on Codd’s invention.<br>
                 For his important benefactions to the theory and practice of database management systems he received in 1981 the A.M Turing award.
