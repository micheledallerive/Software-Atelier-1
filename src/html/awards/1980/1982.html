               <p> Stephen Cook, also knwon as the forefathers of the computational compelxity theory,
                 was entitled of the Turing Award of 1982 thanks to the contributions he gave towards <thead>
                   complexity theory.
                 </thead>
               </p>

               <p> Also, in 1971 Mr. Cook published a paper called "The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures"
                 which has the foundations of the "NP-complete problems" theory; those are problems which cannot be
                 solute by known algorithm.
               </p>
               <p> Moreover, Cook also spent time expanding on Turing's concept of computability (what a machine cannot
                  or can solve). Cook is also the author of the Millennium Problems, which arguments the security systems
                  bearing the digital economy.
               </p>

               <p>Cook hypothesizes that there are optimization problems that cannot be solved by efficient algorithms. A
                 great deal of research in computational complexity theory has been spurred by this conjecture, allowing
                 us to gain a deeper understanding of the inherent challenges of computational problems and how to approach
                 them efficiently. Despite its openness, the conjecture is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems. </p>
