               <h2 class="subtitle">Winners: Ken Thompson / Dennis Ritchie </h2>

               <p>Ritchie joined Thompson in developing a more flexible operating system
                  for Bell Lab's obsolete Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)
                  PDP-7 minicomputer after the removal of the GE machines. </p>

                <p>Thompson also invented a reimplementation of Unix's non-kernel parts
                  based on BCPL and named the interpretive language B. Ritchie added
                  types to B and eventually produced a compiler for C. Thompson and Ritchie
                  greatly simplified Unix development by writing most of the system in C
                  in 1973.
                </p>

               <p> Dennis Ritchie and his partner in developing programming languages
                 and operating systems received the Turing Award in 1983. The award that
                 year was given to them thanks theory, and obviously also thanks to the
                 implementation of the UNIX operating system. Another major invetion made
                 by them was the creation and the developing of the programming language C.
               </p>

               <p> Thanks to their revolutionary inventions and major developments
                 in 1997, they were made a part of the Computer History Museum.
                 Two years later they also received the National Medal of Technology,
                 given by the President at the time Bill Clinton. According to what
                 was said in the citation of the medal, "[They] led to enormous advances in
                 computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated
                 growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership
                 in the Information Age".
