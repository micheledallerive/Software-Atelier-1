               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Niklaus E. Wirth </h2>
         <p>Wirth is famous in computer science from creating two languages: <em>Euler</em> which was based on his dissertation work, and the systems programming language <em>PL360</em> which was for the IBM System/360 series of computers. He won the turing award for developing a sequence of innovative computer languages, EULER, ALGOL-W, MODULA and PASCAL.<br><br>

Wirth was a member of the Algol project to define and implement a set of language standards. The first high level languages were popular because they made for writing and maintaining application programs better. However, because the hardware was limited, compiler techniques were not so well understood, and the languages themselves were difficult for computer companies to implement. Algol 60, the Algol group's most important creation, introduced recursive functions, structured code blocks, and local variables. It was also the first to formalize the syntax of a programming language. <br><br>

The Algol group voted in 1966 against Wirth's proposal to make its next language an extension and improvement of Algol 60. It chose a another design for the Algol 68 proposal. In 1968, Wirth resigned from the group and joined with Tony Hoare to create a new unofficial Algol version, Algol-W.<br><br>

Wirth used Algol-W as the foundation for the Pascal language. Pascal was created for rapid compilation into efficient code. It kept Algol's code structures, logical completeness, and recursion support while removing some of its complexity and including support for complex and user-defined data types.<br><br>

Pascal was introduced for teaching at ETH in 1971, and it quickly spread to other universities. Wirth created a new type of compiler that was written for, and generated code for, a virtual machine to aid in the implementation of Pascal on computers of all types. Pascal's mainstream adoption came a few years later, with the proliferation of personal computers. Pascal's efficiency made it a natural fit for their limited memory and disk space. <br><br>

During the 1970s, Wirth shared the interest in programming methodologies and formal methods of other Algol project veterans such as Edsger Dijksta and Tony Hoare. He was a member of the IFIP Working Group on Programming Methodology, where he provided the idea of stepwise code refinement as a complement to the various visions of "structured programming". His books â€œSystematic Programming and Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" contributed to programming methods.<br><br>

In 1976, he led a project at ETH to build a new graphical workstation. Lilith was a complete computing environment that included an operating system (Medos), high-speed local area networking, text and graphics editors, and laser printers. Its new programming language, Modula-2, extended Pascal by allowing for concurrency and greater code modularity. The first Lilith systems were operational by 1980.<br><br>
