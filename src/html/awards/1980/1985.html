               <p>He is best known for his contributions to algorithm theory, which reflect the structure that is shared by a group of algorithms, such as divide-and-conquer or backtrack. A class's algorithm theory serves as the foundation for design strategies, which are specialized methods for creating -algorithms from formal issue descriptions. <br><br>

As well with the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions to NP-completeness theory. NP-completeness theory is a problem where the validity of each solution can be promptly confirmed, and where a brute-force search method can really find a solution by trying all potential options.<br><br>

Karp pioneered the now-standard approach for showing that problems are NP-complete, which resulted in the identification of numerous theoretical and practical issues as computationally difficult.
