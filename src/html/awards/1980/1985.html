               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Richard Manning Karp</h2>
               <p>He is best known for his contributions to algorithm theory, which reflect the structure that is shared by a group of algorithms, such as divide-and-conquer or backtrack. A class's algorithm theory serves as the foundation for design strategies, which are specialized methods for creating -algorithms from formal issue descriptions. </p>

<p>  As well with the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions to NP-completeness theory. NP-completeness theory is a problem where the validity of each solution can be promptly confirmed, and where a brute-force search method can really find a solution by trying all potential options.</p>

<p>
Karp pioneered the now-standard approach for showing that problems are NP-complete, which resulted in the identification of numerous theoretical and practical issues as computationally difficult.
               </p>
 <h2 class="subtitle">"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"</h2>
              <p>
                This is one of his most significant papers which provides a plausible explanation for the difficulty in finding an effective solution. Karp built on the idea of NP-completeness in that landmark article, demonstrating that if any of twenty-one well-known difficult problems could be solved efficiently by an efficient algorithm, then all of the problems could be solved efficiently. In a sense, NP-completeness demonstrates that these 21 issues are all comparable. The cumulative inability of many competent individuals to create efficient solutions for specific NP-complete problems strongly implies that none exist.</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study introduced a framework for adding new issues to the class of NP-complete problems, which has subsequently evolved to encompass thousands of them. Only one or two classic combinatorial problems remain undeclared in terms of whether or not they are NP-complete. While the majority of the categorized classic problems are NP-complete, few have been demonstrated to be efficiently solved.
