               <p>
                 Tarjan received the Turing Award together with Hopcroft in 1986.
The award states that the reason they both won it was for fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures.
<br><br>
Tarjan is well-known for his work on graph theory algorithms and data structures, which he pioneered.
<br>
Graph algorithms are mathematical structures that are used to represent pairwise relations between objects. In this context, a graph is made up of vertices which are connected by edges.
Data Structures are specialized methods of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that operations on the stored data can be performed more efficiently.
<br><br>
Tarjan's off-line least common ancestors technique and Tarjan's highly linked components algorithm are two of his well-known algorithms, and he was one of five co-authors of the median of medians linear time selection algorithm. The Hopcroft–Tarjan planarity-testing technique was the first to test planarity in linear time.
<br><br>
Hopcroft is well known for his books on algorithms and formal languages, in addition to his research work.<br>
Along with his collaboration with Tarjan on planar graphs, he is best known for developing the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding matchings in bipartite graphs.
