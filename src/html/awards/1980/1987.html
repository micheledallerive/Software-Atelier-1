               <p>
               John Cocke was awarded the Turing award in 1987 for his noteworthy commitments within the compiler design and theory, A compiler translates code written in one language to another without altering the program's meaning. <br><br>
He as well gave significant contributions to large-scale system architecture, and the development of reduced instruction set computers (RISC).<br>
He did this by finding and systematizing numerous fundamental transformations presently utilized in compiler optimization, including operator strength reduction, common subexpression disposal, register allocation, constant propagation, and dead code disposal.
He is considered by many “the father of RISC architecture.”
