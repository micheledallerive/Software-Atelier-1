               <p>
               John Cocke was awarded the Turing award in 1987 for his noteworthy commitments within the compiler design and theory, A compiler translates code written in one language to another without altering the program's meaning. <br><br>
He as well gave significant contributions to large-scale system architecture, and the development of reduced instruction set computers (RISC).<br>
He did this by finding and systematizing numerous fundamental transformations presently utilized in compiler optimization, including operator strength reduction, common subexpression disposal, register allocation, constant propagation, and dead code disposal.
He is considered by many “the father of RISC architecture.”
               </p>
               <p>
                 John Cocke made significant contributions to high-performance computer architecture and the invention of optimizing compilers. He oversaw IBM's 801 Minicomputer project, which began as a pure research effort but eventually evolved into a commercial device.
                 The 801 design philosophy was centered on a close relationship between the hardware and the compiler. The resultant design deviated from the then-common practice of incorporating a large number of complicated instructions into the hardware.

                 <p>
                   Instead, he opted to build the 801 with a modest set of fundamental instructions that were optimized for usage by compilers. This had a significant influence on computer architecture development and was eventually referred to as the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) method.
                   Together with a small group of collaborators, they recognized that a carefully defined set of machine instructions, combined with programs produced by a compiler carefully designed to exploit that instruction set, could result in a very high performance pipelined processor with lower cost and fewer circuits than a computer using complex instructions.
