               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Ivan Sutherland</h2>
               <p>Ivan Sutherland won the Turing Award in 1988 for his visionary contribution to computer graphics and invention of <strong>Sketchpad</strong>.
                  Originally, computers were text only (with a few exceptions), but with the invention of Sketchpad, things changed.

                  <h2 class="subtitle">Sketchpad</h2>
                  It's considered the first interactive computer-graphics program and was invented by Ivan Sutherland in 1961. The program
                  allowed users to visualize and control program functions. In short he had created the framework of modern computer graphics.
               </p>

               <p>The system was initially developed in a facility dedicated to expanding the USA's defense systems in the aftermath of the second
                  World War. However, Sketchpad initially had no intentions of being designed for the US Army. It was simply the product of an
                  attempt to not only utilize the computer but also communicate with it. Sutherland had never imagined that the development of
                  Sketchpad would have had such a strong impact in the future, because he did not think about all the different applications.
               </p>

               <p>The program could establish a connection between the user
                  and the machine by using a light pen used to draw directly on the computer monitor. This  program also proved to everyone that
                  computers could automate repetitive design with accuracy and reliability; something that could not be replicated by humans.
                  <br>
                  The program was cleverly organized by the use of objects and instances which pointed forward to what we know as:"object oriented
                  programming".
                  <br>
                  Clearly, from what we've seen so far Sutherland was the pioneer of 3D computer modeling and visual simulation which are the
                  foundations of today's programs such as CAD.
