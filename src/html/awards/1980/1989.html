               <p>William Kahan won the Turing Award in 1989 for his contribution to numerical analysis.
                  He is considered one of the foremost experts on floating-point computations, and in 1989 he won the Turing Award for his work
                  in creating the IEEE 754 standard, therefore he is known as "The Father of Floating Point".
               </p>

               <p><h2 class="subtitle">But what is the IEEE 754 standard?</h2>
                  The IEEE 754 standard for floating-point computing is the most widely used standard in the field of automated computing. This
                  standard defines the format for the representation of floating-point numbers and a set of operations that can be performed on them.
                  There are four formats for floating-point numbers in this standard that vary depending on the amount of bits:
                  single-precision, double-precision, extended single-precision and extended double-precision.
                  This standard is used to specify methods for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming environments, thus
                  this has become a mandatory standard for modern computer science.
               </p>

               <p>In short the IEEE 754 Format makes us express floating point numbers in a form that the computer can understand since it was able
                  to overcome the biggest problem, which was keeping track of the decimal point.
                  Because of this, nowadays the Format is implemented in many programming languages to represent their data types, such as floats or
                  doubles. An example could be Java that uses as a subset of the IEEE 754 binary floating point standard to represent the Float data type
                  and the result of arithmetic operations. However, not all programming languages follow this standard, for example, Python is one of them,
                  since it creates a higher level abstraction for its floating point numbers.
