            Decade Overview
            <h1>
            <p>During the 8th Decade of the 19th centuary, many great progress were made by famouses computer scientists. The ones that stand out the most are the ones made by Dennis Ritchie, Niklaus Wirth and John Cocke. <br> <br> <br>
Starting from Dennis Ritchie whom was given the Turing award in 1983, it is obvious that he helped the future of infromatics a lot by programming with his patner Ken Thompson, whom also got a Turing Award the same year, by making the Programming language B which simply was a predecessor of the C programming language. They also accomplished to create the Operating System Unix.
<br> <br>
Niklaus Wirth got a Turning Award the following year of Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, exaclty in 1984. He accomplished to complete the programming language Pascal, an innovative computer language.
<br> <br>
John Cocke got the Award on 1987. He was the inventor (also called the father) of the RISC term and architecture. Moreover, he was aknowledge for his massive and helpful contribution to the study of Computers architecture.</p>
