               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Fernando J. Corbató</h2>
               <p>Fernando J. Corbató, also known by everyone as "Corby", won the Turing Award in 1990 for his contribution to time sharing systems.
                  After obtaining his Ph.D. in Physics in 1956 started working in the research field inside the MIT and in 1961 he proposed a small
                  project that would change completely interactive computing.
               </p>

               <h2 class="subtitle">CTSS</h2>
               <p>In the 1950s many people had a problem with the way they accessed computers, and they didn't like the fact that only one user could
                  connect to the computer and run a program, which would usually take hours or even days. To solve this, some people in MIT proposed
                  the concept of "time-sharing", where multiple users could connect simultaneously.
                 <br>
                  Corby then proposed a small project to solve this kind of problem in 1961, so, he and his colleagues started working on the computer: IBM 709.
                  This resulted in the creation of the first known operative system in time-sharing: CTSS (Compatible Time Sharing System).
                  The system rapidly became popular because it allowed 4 users to simultaneously work on the same machine. The basic concept behind the
                  system is that suspended programs would be saved on 4 magnetic tape drives, allowing simultaneous access for the users.
               </p>

               <h2 class="subtitle">Multics</h2>
               <p>Corby did not stop his research on time sharing systems and kept improving CTSS with updated versions.
                 <br>
                  In 1962, a new project by the name of Project MAC started, and Corby was taking part in it. The project included the development of
                  a new updated CTSS version that was then called Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service). This is an important milestone
                  in Operating Systems development, since Multics brought many innovative and valuable ideas.
                  <br>
                  Multics was used from 1965 until 2000, and during that time it became a commercial product widely used by everyone.
