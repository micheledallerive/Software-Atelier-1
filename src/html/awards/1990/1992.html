               <p>
                Butler W. Lampson received the touring award in 1992 for the contributions to the development of distributed personal computing environments and the technology for their implementation: Workstations, networks, operating system, programming systems, display security and document publishing.
                   </p>
                   <h2 class="subtitle">Why did he win the award?</h2>
                   <p>
                    A distributed computing environment is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate action in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end user. There are two principal way a distributed system can work:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each machine works toward a common goal and the end user views the result as one cohesive unit</li>
                        <li>
                            each machine has its own end user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                   </p>
                   <h2 class="subtitle">Why is it important?</h2>
                   <p>
                    Modern computing wouldn’t be possible without distributed systems. They’re essential to the operations of wireless networks, cloud computing services and the internet. If distributed systems didn’t exist, neither would any of these technologies:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Telecommunications networks</li>
                        <li>Graphical and video-rendering systems</li>
                        <li>scientific computing,</li>
                        <li>Airline and hotel reservation systems</li>
                        <li>Peer-to-peer sharing systems</li>
                        <li>Global distributed retailers and supply chain management </li>
                        <li>And so on</li>
                    </ul>
