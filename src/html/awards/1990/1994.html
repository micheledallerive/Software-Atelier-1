               <p>
                 Raj Reddy and Edward Feigenbaum won the Turing Award in 1994 for defining and demonstrating  the field of applied artificial intelligence.
                 Raj Reddy worked in comuputer speech recognition, robotics, human-computer interaction, innovations in higher education . He wanted to bring digital technology to the people so that they can interact to it.
                 Edward worked in the design and construction  of large scale artificial intelligence systems.
                 He demonstrated the practical importance and potential commercial impact of artificial intelligence technology.
                 <h3 class="subtitle"> Expert Systems </h3>
                 Edward Feigenbaum is considered as the father of expert systems.
                 Expert systems are computer programs wich use encoded knowledge of experts in fields like: Chemistry, medical diagnosis and therapy, geologic exploration, hardware and sotware trouble-shooting and business practice.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Feigenbaum stayed at Carnegie Tech and did a PhD dissertation on a computer model that simulates how human learn nonsense syllabes . Feigenbaum partecipated in the implementation of the first publicity avaible list-processing language, IPL-V.
                 <br>
                 <h4 class="subtitle"> Example of Expert System applied in chemistry </h4>
                 Joshua Ledeberg wanted to induce the threedimensional structure of these chemicals from their mass spectrograms. He suggested to Feigenbaum the problem. Feigenbaum and his team  developed <b>Heuristic DENDRAL</b>, a computer program which give you the geometrical structure given their chemical formulae and their mass spectrogram data. Many unknown structure were discovered thanks to that program .
