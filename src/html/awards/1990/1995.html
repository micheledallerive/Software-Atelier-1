                Manuel Blum
               </h2>
               <p>Manuel Blum won Turing Award in 1995 for appliying the foundations of computanional complexity into application to cryptography and program checking.
In 1971 Blum has found an Algorithm that find the median in linear time.
Blum by trying to discover the essence of complexity defined a theory plenty of unexpected results.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Blum’s speed up theorem </h3>
This theorem  says that a specific algorithm can be modified to run esponentially faster, and this algorithm can be modified many times so that we can have an infinite  exponential improvements.

<h3>Criptography</h3>
Public key criptography allowed secure communication by using one-way functions that are easy to compute but not so easy to reverse. But as Blum’s complexity concept was related to randomness, he searched for a cryptographically strong pseudorandom generator: a public key encryption scheme based on the Blum-Blum-Shub generator.
This generator has been matematically proven to be as hard to break as factoring.

<h3>CAPTCHA
<br>
(“Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”)
</h3>
Blum and his student created the CAPTCHA test, more precisely it is a visual test to verify if the problem is solvable by the computer program or if was solved by the program itself. The goal was to predict bots with base intentions, and this was possible thanks to a kind of twisted Turing tests.
