               Amir Pnueli won the Turing Award in 1996 for introducing temporal logic into computing science. He also contributed to program and system verification. In 1962 he was intrroduced to <b>WEIZAC</b>, the first computer in Israel.

            <h3>The “Temporal Logic of Programs”</h3>
            With this seminal paper he won the Turing Award and proved that practical program verification wasn’t hopeless. He introduced programs as execution paths and that was an innovation in the field of program verification.
            <br>
            In this seminal he introduce two formal system for providing a basis for temporal reasoning and to confirm that the time dependence of event is the basic concept:
            <ul>
              <li>Formalization of the method of intermittent assertions.</li>
              <li>Adaptation of the tense logic system Kb</li>
            </ul>
