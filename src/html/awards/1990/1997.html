               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Douglas Engelbart</h2>
               <p>The Turing Award 1997 was won by Douglas Engelbart, an engineer from United States.
                 He was rewarded <i>"for an inspiring vision of the future of interactive computing and the invention of key technologies to help realize this vision"</i>.<br>
                 His work life revolved around the idea of using computer technology and software to address complicated and pressing challenges.
                 Douglas Engelbart's numerous technological breakthroughs were crucial in the development of personal computing and the Internet and as a result of his efforts,
                 computers have progressed from specialized tools that could only be used by expert technicians to a medium designed
                 to boost users' intelligence and foster collaboration.
                 Thanks to some fundings he received from Stanford Research Institute (SRI), Engelbart was able to create his own research laboratory, the Augmentation
                 Research Center, which soon became the source of many crucial hardware and software innovations such as: the mouse, integrated email, display editing,
                 windows, cross-file editing, idea/outline processing, hypermedia, shared-screen teleconferencing, online publishing, and groupware.<br>
                 Before Engelbart's invention, computers were controlled by laborious and error-prone keypunch cards or manually set electronic switches, and data
                 had to be printed before it could be read. All the technologies he invented aimed to reduce this obstacles.
                 Interfaces are viewed as extensions of human activities rather than as intermediaries between humans and machines.
                 Englebart's work strives to improve human capabilities by combining technology innovation with human creativity which doesn't mean that people will have less
                 to do thanks to the machine (automation), but rather that they will be able to do more with it (augmentation).
