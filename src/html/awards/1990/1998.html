               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: James Nicholas Gray</h2>
               <p>The Turing Award 1998 was won by James (“Jim”) Nicholas Gray, an American computer scientist.
                 He won the award “<i>for seminal contributions to database and transaction processing research and technical leadership in system implementation</i>”.<br><br>
                 Gray was a key contributor to System R, combining his systems and theory expertise to develop a holistic approach to the interconnected challenges of concurrency
                 management and crash recovery. He defined the transaction as a unit of work, such as moving money from one bank account to another, that must leave the bank's database
                 in a consistent state whether the transaction succeeds or fails: the money must either move or remain in the original account. Gray devised methods for running several
                 transactions at the same time, as well as restarting after a crash, all while maintaining database consistency. He demonstrated that the strategy was correct.<br>
                 His Turing Award was given in recognition of this work. Gray assisted in the transfer of the technology to IBM product groups as the research component of System R
                 came to a conclusion, and he began thinking about how to expand transactions to a distributed network of interacting computers.
                 Gray thought the relational database model and SQL data access language were solid foundations for online applications, but he was concerned about users' inability
                 to compare the offerings of different hardware and software suppliers.
                 He created end user-oriented performance benchmarks and assisted in the formation of the Transaction Processing Performance Council, a vendor-neutral organization
                 that oversees their impartial implementation. As a result, companies have been competing for more than a decade to improve their products.<br>
                 He presented one of the first publications containing statistics from production fault tolerant systems, revealing that system management and software bugs were
                 the most common causes of system failure.
                 Gray explored how geographical distribution of computer systems and terminal networks interacted with availability, consistency, and other desirable features of
                 the overall system as customer demand for geographical distribution of computer systems and terminal networks grew. While at Tandem, he wrote numerous technical
                 studies and publications that helped customers plan their applications, Tandem engineers plan product developments, and contributed to the open literature on a wide
                 range of topics related to performance, reliability, availability, and ease of use.
