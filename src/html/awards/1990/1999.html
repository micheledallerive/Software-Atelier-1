               <h2 class="subtitle">Winner: Frederick Phillips Brooks</h2>
               <p>The Turing Award 1999 was won by Frederick Phillips Brooks, an American computer architect, software engineer, and computer scientist, best known for managing
                 the development of IBM's System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software support package.<br>
                 He won the Award “for landmark contributions to computer architecture, operating systems, and software engineering.”<br></p>
                 <h3>IBM 7090</h3>
                 <p>He was involved in the development of the IBM 7090 "Stretch" supercomputer. Although it was a commercial failure, it was responsible for the development of a number
                   of advanced concepts that are now commonplace in modern computing, including instruction look-ahead, overlapping and pipelining of instruction execution, error checking
                   and correction, and the 8-bit addressable character. For the Stretch, Brooks and colleague engineer Dura Sweeney developed an interrupt system, which has since been
                   widely imitated as an important feature in all modern computers that undertake concurrent processes and react to events in the physical world (U.S. Patent 3,048,332).<br>
                   Brooks moved on to work on the architecture of the IBM Harvest, a variation of the Stretch with enhanced security features for the National Security Agency.
                   Later, he assisted the authorities in assessing the Soviet Union's computing capabilities.</p>
                 <h3>From IBM 8000 to System/360</h3>
                 <p>Brooks was then tasked with assisting in the development of the IBM 8000, a new transistorized mainframe computer that was to succeed the IBM 700/7000 series.
                   However, by the early 1960s, the global computer business had become extremely congested, with multiple companies producing proprietary, incompatible systems.
                   Customers recognized that as they replaced slower systems with faster ones, their software investment was becoming an increasing problem because they had to recreate
                   it for each new system.<br>
                   Bob Evans pushed IBM's goal of creating a single product line of general-purpose computers with an uniform instruction set that would allow customers to keep their
                   software investments when they upgraded from slower to faster machines. Brooks was appointed by Evans to lead the team that designed the System/360 product line,
                   which was announced in 1964. Brooks created the term "computer architecture" to refer to the structure and behavior of computer processors and associated devices as
                   opposed to the specifics of any hardware implementation.<br><br>
                   The System/360's significance cannot be overstated: it was a hugely successful project that changed the face of commercial computing and revolutionized the landscape of
                   computer companies all over the world. Brooks was particularly proud of the 8-bit byte, which enabled the use of capital and lowercase alphabets and increased the role of
                   computers in text processing, among many other contributions to the System/360's architecture. While the physical architecture for the System/360 was well along, it was evident
                   that delivering the operating system for the next series of workstations was fraught with danger.<br>
                   Brooks was given the task of leading the software team in the development of what was arguably the largest operating system project at the time.</p>
