               <p>The Turing Award 2000 was won by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a world renowned Chinese computer scientist and computational theorist.
                 He won the Award “<i>In recognition of his fundamental contributions to the theory of computation, including the complexity-based theory of pseudorandom number
                 generation, cryptography, and communication complexity</i>“.<br>
                 Yao's min-max principle, which employs von Neumann's minimax theorem from game theory to relate average-case complexity for deterministic algorithms to worst-case
                 complexity for randomized algorithms, was introduced in his 1977 paper "Probabilistic computations: toward a unified measure of complexity."
                 Yao's concept has been extended to domains such as property testing and learning theory, and has become a key approach for reasoning about randomized algorithms and complexity.
                 He also made significant contributions to the theory of data structures around this period.
                 In the paper "Should tables be sorted?" he wrote in 1978, he proposed the cell-probe model, an abstract model of data structures in which the total amount of memory
                 accesses is used to calculate the cost of a computation. This paradigm has been widely used in the creation of algorithm lower bound proofs.
                 Yao published a number of studies in the early 1980s that influenced the foundations of cryptography, computer security, computational complexity, and randomized computation.
                 These studies were noteworthy not simply because of the outcomes, but also because they introduced challenges, models, and procedures that are today regarded basic in their fields.
                 "On the Security of Public-Key Protocols," a paper he co-authored with Danny Dolev in 1981, established a formal paradigm for symbolic reasoning about security
                 protocols. This "Dolev-Yao model" has been the starting point for most work on symbolic security since its debut, including current work on the security of
                 complexity-based encryption. It is still a hot topic of research. In addition, Yao made major contributions to cryptography and security approaches based on complexity.
                 These publications are foundational in the fields of cryptography and safe computation.<br>
                 Professor Yao established concepts and approaches in the 1980s that are stull currently being used in complexity, computational randomness, cryptography,
                 and security research. Yao also made significant contributions to the theory of lower bounds for algebraic decision trees, which he pioneered in a 1982 study
                 co-authored with J.M. Steel.
                 Security protocols, universally composable secure computation, quantum computing, and algorithm theory are among his latest contributions.
