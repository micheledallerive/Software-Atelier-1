               <p>
                 The Turing Award was given in 2001 to the Norwegian duo Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard, responsible for major contributions to the creation and diffusion of object-oriented programming. By designing the Simula programming languages, they clearly and thoroughly defined the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, such as objects, classes, and inheritance, in order to achieve a high level of abstraction and to create a programming language that captures and reflects real-life events and contexts. Therefore, the Simula languages are considered the first object-oriented programming languages.
                </p>

               <p>
                 The name Simula refers to two programming languages: the Simula 67 and the Simula I system description simulation language. Dahl and Nygaard started working on the Simula in the 1960â€™s in Oslo, the capital city of Norway, at the Norwegian Computing Center. The Simula (later known as Simula I for distinction from Simula 67), as the name suggests, was originally intended to model real-life simulations. The Simula 67, on the other hand, is a later evolved all-purpose programming language.
               </p>

               <p>
                 Object-oriented programming is a programming model that entails a data-and-object-based approach of designing computer programs, as opposed to focusing on functions and logic. The most important feature of an an object-oriented programming language is the ability to define a class. Any particular type of data can be defined as a class, with a distinct set of attributes and behaviors assigned to it, and furthermore, to create an instance of a class, an object can be made. By doing so, we are able to take advantage of inheritance, which is the capability of basing an object/class on another object/class. The Simula languages were the first capable of doing so.
               </p>

               <p>
                 The invention of object-oriented programming had major influence on Computer Science in the forthcoming years, and heavily impacted the structure of all programming languages to be made in the future.
