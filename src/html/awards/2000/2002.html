               <p>
                 The Turing Award of 2002 was granted to three cryptographers: Leonard Max Adleman, Adi Shamir, and Ronald Linn Rivest, for giving practical use to public-key cryptography. They did so by inventing the RSA public-key cryptosystem (named after the three scientists), which utilizes algorithmic number theory to encipher all kinds of data, from secret messages to digital transactions. RSA is now the most diffused encryption method to assure the security of online commercial transactions.
                </p>
               <p>
                 The RSA code was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and finalized in 1977. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman were originally inspired by the work of Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman about asymmetric cryptosystems. They went on to found the RSA Security LLC. Soon afterwards, MIT was granted the patent for the RSA algorithm on 20 September 1983.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The cryptosystem relies on the product of two large prime numbers, also called a semiprime, that imposes the Prime Factoring Problem, i.e. the near impossibility of decomposing a large number into a product of integers, especially if the number a semiprime, without the use of a quantum computer. There has not yet been discovered an algorithm capable of solving for such number. In the RSA cryptosystem, the encryption key is visible to all, and is constructed from the sum of an auxiliary value and the semiprime. The decryption key, on the contrary, is private, and consists of the two prime numbers making up the semiprime.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Thanks to the reliability of RSA code, the utilization of different features of the internet that require security and privacy, such as online transactions, have become so widespread, and we are able to effortlessly transmit confidential information.
