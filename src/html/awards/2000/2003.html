               <p>
                 The Turing Award for the Year 2003 was awarded to Alan Curtis Kay. He mainly contributed to the basic ideas of object-oriented programming and lead the development team of Smalltalk. He is also known as the father of personal computers.
                </p>
               <p>
                 Smalltalk is an object-oriented programming language developed throughout the 1970s, with its stable version released under the name Smalltalk-80 in the year 1980. Its first version, titled Smalltalk-71 was created because of a bet that Kay had made, stating that he will be able to develop a language, inspired by Simula’s message passing, that would take up only “a single page of code”. Later, however, it was developed into a complete programming environment with a user interface, a debugger, an object-oriented virtual memory, and an editor. It is considered the first dynamic object-oriented programming language.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Kay then went on to use the programming language he created to develop the Xerox Alto Computer, that is seen by many as the first personal computer. It is deemed as a revolutionary product, because it was the first to include a graphical operating system in its inception design.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Alan Kay is a pioneer of various concepts, not only PCs and object-oriented programming, but also the laptop and its use as a digital tool for education. His work and contributions to the world of informatics still inspire and impact many today.
