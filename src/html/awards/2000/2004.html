               <p>
                 The winners of the Turing Award 2004, Vinton Gray Cerf and Robert Elliot Kahn are known as the fathers of the Internet, primarily because of their immense contribution to the development of the Internet, by designing the basic internet protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).
               </p>
               <p>
                 The two computer scientists met each other while working on the ARPANET, a project initiated in 1966 by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense. It was the first packet-switched computer network, in which the data meant to be transmitted would be divided into packets, and among the first to utilize the TCP and IP. This project is considered as the direct predecessor of the Internet as we know it today.
               </p>
               <p>
                 TCP ensures that the given data is divided into packets, sorted in the right order, assembled in the new computer, and that none of it is missing. IP, on the other hand, is the protocol responsible for the transmission of data to the correct addresses connected to the computer network.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Kahn additionally developed the basics of open-architecture networking, which allow different computers, regardless of their hardware or software, to communicate among each other, and therefore facilitating the use of the Internet.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The invention of the Internet protocol suite marks the start of the digital revolution and was a significant milestone in the history of not only computer science but also communications, entertainment, and commerce, primarily by facilitating the easy and effortless use of a new type of technology.
