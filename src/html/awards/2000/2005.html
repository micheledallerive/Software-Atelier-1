 Peter Naur introduces a design concept of the Gier ALGOL language.
With this The GIER has become a machine marketed as DISADEC (This abbreviation refers to the minimum configuration for which the ALGOL compiler was designed)
<br>
The objectives of the project were as follows
<br>
1. GIER ALGOL was supposed to be a practical work system that took full
advantage of the machine to the extent that this is compatible with the generality of the ALGOL 60 language and a deadline upon completion of a compiler
<br>
2. It had to include an error detection from the source
program and had to be able to find any number of errors in one
compilation run.
<br>
The objectives of the project were as follows
<br>
a) Design focused on storing variables in one mound, basically catachresis to Dijkstra's design
<br>
b) Program storage was handled by automatic administration of transfers from the main depository at runtime, completely integrated with mound administration.
<br>
c) The translator's design is based on storage space.
<br>
d) During translation, error handling is integrated
