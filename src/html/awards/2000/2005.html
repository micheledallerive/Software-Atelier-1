               <p>
                 Peter Naur introduces a design concept of the Gier ALGOL language.
   The GIER became a machine
   marketed as DISADEC. This abbreviation refers to the minimum
   configuration for which the ALGOL compiler was designed.
   <br>
   The objectives of the project were as follows:
   <br>
1. GIER ALGOL was to be a practical work system that took full
advantage of the machine to the extent that this is compatible with the generality of the ALGOL 60 language and a deadline on the completion of a compiler
<br>
2. It had to include an error detection from the source
program and had to be able to find any number of errors in one
compilation run.
<br>
The objectives of the project were as follows:
<br>
a) The design focused on storing variables in a stack, basically similar to Dijkstra's design
<br>
b) Program storage was handled by automatic administration
of transfers from the main repository at runtime, completely
integrated with stack administration.
<br>
c) Translator design is based on storage space.
<br>
d) During translation, error handling is integrated
