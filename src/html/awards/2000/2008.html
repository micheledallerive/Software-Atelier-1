               <h3> Venus operating system </h3>
                  <p>She has firstly created the Venus OS, which is a multiprogramming system built to give the opportunity to multiple users to work on the same machine. She figured out that in the previous OSs, which were built using boxes that can access information in outside ones while not in inside ones, the usage of global variables was massive and that this caused a big mess in the whole system. So she figured out that the best way in which to organise a system was to break global variables up in different “partitions”  so that each one can be in charge of a particular program module, which was the only part in the system where you can access specific datas. So in this way she prevented errors arising from conflicts regarding the usage, at the same time, of the same resources.
                  </p>
                  <h3> CLU programming language </h3>
                     <p>
                       CLU programming language was ahead compared to other programming languages because it included lots of OOP's characteristics, even if not all. It was based on data abstraction, polymorphism, modular programming and heap oriented.
                       <ul>
                        <li> Data abstraction means that there is a clear separation between how data is being represented and how data is handled and manipulated internally by the program. </li>
                        <li> Polymorphism means that the language gives to the programmer the ability to create single interfaces that can use variables of different types at different times. </li>
                        <li> Modular programming means that each computer program can be divided into multiple sub-programs, so that each one of them can solve a specific problem </li>
                      </ul>
                     </p>
                 <h3> Substitution Principle </h3>
                     <p>
                       While dealing with object-oriented programming languages, she founded the idea of hierarchical types, in which superclasses define supertypes that can be extended by the subclasses, making them a subtypes, fascinating but also that it wasn’t well understood. What she found was an informal rule regarding this type of operation, which is called Substitution Principle, that defines a subtype as “a type that behaves like the supertype, as far as you use the supertype methods”.
                      </p>
                  <h3> Daily life usage </h3>
                      <p>
                        Her work in developing Clu programming language and in defining the substitution principle has been helpful because, without that, there would not exist some of the most known and used programming, such as Java, C# and C++, which are used daily to develop softwares we normally use in our life. Furthermore the fact of developing Venus has helped a lot in creating OSs that can be used by multiple users at the same time, very helpful for businesses.
