               <h3>Charles Thacker  </h3>
                  <p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has named Charles Thacker the winner of the 2009 A.M. Turing Award for the pioneering design and realization of the first modern personal computer -- the Alto at Xerox PARC -- and seminal inventions and contributions to local area networks (including the Ethernet), multiprocessor workstations and tablet personal computers.
                  <h3> Multiprocessor workstations </h3>
                     <p>
                       The first computer project he worked on was the “Genie” project, which regarded the development of the first time sharing system. The goal of the project was to build a time sharing system, which is a machine shared by multiple users that manages resources in terms of time, which led to the creation of the Berkeley Timesharing Machine, that then became the first time sharing machine ever commercialized, called SDS 940.
                       Then Thacker moved to the BBC, where he and his team were wanting to create a system capable of supporting up to 500 remote users at the same time. So they built the BCC 500 using multiple independent microprogrammed processors, which were divided as follows: two were used to run user programs, one was for job scheduling, one for managing drum memory and disk I/O, and one for handling remote terminals. The system’s console was an IBM 360/30. Even if the BCC 500 used a magnetic core for main memory, it also had a cache, which allowed to speed up the whole system. Charles was responsible for the design of the microprogrammed processor and of the equipment for supporting remote users, by redirecting their traffic over the fastest data connections of the time.
                       After two years the team managed to make the BCC 500 system work successfully, but the missing funds combined with the 1970 recession made the company close.

                 <h3> The first Personal Computer </h3>
                     <p>
                       After the experience in the BCC, Thacker and his team moved to the PARC. There, the idea was to create the “paperless office”, and so they started working on the Alto. What they came out with was an approach based on the bitmapped display, so that each pixel represented on the display  is represented by a bit stored in video memory. They decided to adopt that method of representing information on the screen because they understood the validity of Moore’s law, and realized that the semiconductor memory used in MAXC, the computer built by the team to get enough computability capability for that project, would quickly get larger, faster, and cheaper. Furthermore, the idea was that, in the future, It would be possible to build a new type of display where each pixel on the screen was drepresented by a single bit of memory.
                       In 1973 they finally built the Alto, the first computer system that we would recognize today as a personal computer and whose hardware was designed by Chuck and Ed McCreight.
                       The next step was to make Alto become inexpensive. To achieve this, Chuck decided to revolutionize the usual assumptions of how minicomputers work. Rather than multiplex the memory between the CPU and I/O controllers, the machine would multiplex the processor among independent microcoded tasks. In this way I/O controllers complexity can be among multiple single microcoded tasks. Alto may have been the first simultaneously-multithreaded (SMT) computer.
                       Alto was designed so that the addition of new I/O devices can be implemented with a small amount of hardware and microcode. One of the first extensions was the Ethernet local area network. Ethernet allowed Altos to be connected into a distributed system, and much of the early distributed systems work.
                       Afterwards, Chuck also developed the AN1 and AN2 networks. AN1 was a packet-switching network, so based on sending packets from point A to point B, that employed 10 Mb/s point-to-point links at a time when 1 Mbit/s Ethernet was the fastest commercially available LAN technology. Then, in the late 80’s, he started developing AN2, which attempted to use 622 Mb/s ATM technology as a LAN. It was commercialized, but it was not very successful, since 100 Mb Ethernet switches were becoming available at much lower cost.

                      <h3> The first Tablet Computer </h3>
                        <p>
                          In 1999 he decided to work with Microsoft’s group developing the Microsoft Tablet PC. Chuck was responsible for designing the prototype hardware, using Silicon Valley subcontractors for much of the engineering. His efforts resulted, in 2001, in the release of Tablet PC.

                        <h3> Daily life applications </h3>
                        <p>
                          Nowadays, every day, we use technologies that are literally based on his ideas and studies. In fact, without his efforts, today we may not can use technologies such as the tablet, which hardware was developed by him, or time sharing personal computers, that are very fast and give to the user the illusion of the existence of multitasking PCs.Furthermore, his efforts in creating the BCC 500 has made it possible, for the University of Hawaii, to develop the ALOHA System, that is the first t to provide a public demonstration that wireless packet data networks could be built.
