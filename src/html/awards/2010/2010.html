               <h3> Leslei Valiant </h3>
                  <p cite="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/valiant_2612174.cfm">
                    The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has named Leslei Gabriel Valiant the winner of the 2010 A.M. Turing Award for transformative contributions to the theory of computation, including the theory of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, the complexity of enumeration and of algebraic computation, and the theory of parallel and distributed computing.
                  </p>
                  <h3> PAC </h3>
                     <p>
                       In 1983 he published an important paper in which he devised a model of learning that, based on a quantitative evaluation, can detect if a computer is able to learn. This model is called the probably approximately correct (PAC), and had been crucial to develop the computational learning theory. In that model, an algorithm is considered to be learning if, based on previous experiences, he can create some hypothesis that can be used in future events with controlled errors.
                     </p>
                 <h3> Discovery of P#-completeness</h3>
                     <p>
                       In the early 1970’s, computational complexity generally dealt with many difficult problems,  such as whether a graph has a perfect matching, that were distinguished into two different classes. which were P (tractable problems) and NP (problems where the result was easy to check, but where the main problem was to find a result in the first place). What Valiant came out with was the discovery that counting problems are much more easy to compute than what was thinked before. In his paper “The complexity of computing the permanent” he showed that counting perfect matchings of a graph, for example, is as hard as any counting problem, including for any NP problem. So Valiant has extended the previous theory of complexity with a new counting class: #P.

                       In that video he discusses the origin of P# based on the analysis of the approach of previous problems: <br>

                      </p>
                  <h3> Parallel and Distributed Computing </h3>
                      <p>
                        He worked on analyzing how very large parallel computing systems work, investing a high range of types of computer, that goes from the multi-core processors, used at most in personal computers, to large computing machines. He focused on understanding how communication happens between parallel processors. In 1990 he published a paper where he described the model he invented:  the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP).
                        He decided to center his research on communication because, when working with a big amount of processes, the main problem was a bottleneck. So he worked on the routing phase, and he found that by quantifying synchronization requisites he could improve parallel processors processes.
