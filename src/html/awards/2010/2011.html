               <h3> Origins </h3>
               <p> His first research topic was superconductive paramedic amplifiers. Nevertheless, his passion was intelligent systems and this is why he decided to focus on logic and reasoning. He eventually started an academic career by joining the University of California. After several years he founded the cognitive systems laboratory in 1978 in order to better understand intelligent systems and their applicability on human interaction. From his point of belief, probability and decision   were from big importance such analysis provides accurate outcomes.

                Conditional independence was a fundamental part in his research in order to revolutionise Artificial Intelligence. In order to be able to develop complex probability models which have a large amount of polynomial parameters where needed for organising distributed computations.
                Automated reasoning, bayesian networks, causal inference and human cognition are his main research topics.
                <h3> Turing Award </h3>
               <p>
                 Judea Pearl won the Turing award  in 2011 for his significant contributions in the field of artificial intelligence. He developed a calculus in order to reason probabilistic and casual reasoning. This enables Artificial Intelligence to cope with uncertain situation and to react accordingly to relationships and hypothesises. Counterfactuals in form of algorithms revolutionised several area of empirical sciences. Achieving cooperative behaviour between humans and machines can be enhanced by not only using boolean logic for decision making, but also by incorporating a maybe as another option. With this achievement he revolutionised the field of Artificial Intelligence.
