               <h3> Berkley University </h3>
               <p> Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali met for the first time at the University of Berkley. This is where their initial research initiated as they started working together. In their research they tried to answer the question: "What is a secret?". This is when they started working on encryption. </p>
              <h3> Turing Award </h3>
               <p>
                 In order to win the 2012 Turing Award, Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali revolutionised the complexity and theoretic foundations on cryptography. Probabilistic encryption was first written in 1982 by the both award winners. This paper set the foundation for the contribution. How does one define a secret is the posed question in the paper. Probabilistic encryption, semantic security as well as computational indistinguishability was dressed in the paper early on. These topics were combined in order to create a public encryption-arrangement. As the verifier does not receive any knowledge of the information, it is not possible to stimulate any knowledge on his own probability distribution, while interacting with the prover. The zero-knowledge approach is still being researches today and that is possible to not disclose nor gain any knowledge on inputs made by other individuals which follow form the value of the function. <br>

                Information protection schemes need to be made random with exponential many encodings which correspond to each message. This ensures encryption techniques for secure transactions, safe transmission and storage of data. Together they laid the foundation of a transformational work that is now seen as the foundations for the science of cryptography.
