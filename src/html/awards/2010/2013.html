               <h3> Early origins of the price winning idea </h3>
               <p>As Leslie Lamport spent most of his time in an industrial research environment, he started working on concurrent programming for multiple processors.Lamport used many fundamental concepts in computer science to work on algorithms as these have become a standard for distributed systems. Notably the Baker Algorithm which was discovered by Lamport, set a big foundation for his distributed systems and algorithms by having mutual exclusion with not having to rely on lower-level mutual exclusion and increasing its safety. In addition, Lamport is also known as the inventor of LaTex. </p>
               <h3> Turing Award </h3>
               <p>
                 In 2013 Leslie Lamport won the Truing Award. Distributed Systems used to be rather chaotic before Leslie Lamport figured out a way to enable several computer to autonomously communicate with each other. By coming up with new forms of algorithms, modelling and verification protocols were created in order to enhance distributed systems and its quality by concurrency as well as performance in general and their reliability. This started all off when Leslie Lamport started discovering the Baker Algorithm which discarded bugs and issues on concurrent programming to eventually adjust algorithms and develop specifications and verification of concurrent systems.
