               <h3> Ingres </h3>
               <p> While working at Berkley University, what Michael Stonebreaker has been doing for a total of approx. 25 years, he founded the Ingres and Postgres. Ingres was a a project with the initial idea of being a geographically-oriented system with graphical capabilities. Nevertheless, this idea adjusted over the years to become one of the most influential database management systems from which originated even new and different database systems. The foundation for a commercial database idea was born. Unlike IBMâ€™s prototype for databases, Ingres was a unix application targeting mini computers and providing a flexible way of storing and retrieving data. By being based on C, Ingres eventually automatically optimised queries and compressed methods.
              </p>
              <h3> Postgress </h3>
              <p> As successful Ingres was, some features were lacking and these were resolved with Postgres. Object related data types, reproduction of data among serves, embedding of code fragments in database management were some issues which were resolved with Postgres. Temporal data storage, extensible types and object-relational concepts of databases were concepts newly introduced by Postgres. </p>
              <h3> Turing Award </h3>
               <p>

                In 2014 Michael Stonebraker received the Turing Award. His contribution regarding databases helped
                him to receive the award. By his research activities at the University of Berkeley he laid the foundation for receiving the award. Ingres and Postgres had a significant contribution to the award winning decision. With Ingres the foundation of commercial databases was born in form of an Unix application targeting mini computers and making databases commercially available. Object related data types, reproduction of data among serves, embedding of code fragments in database management were some issues which were resolved with Postgres. Temporal data storage, extensible types and object-relational concepts of databases were concepts newly introduced by Postgres.
                Big data storage was revolutionised by Stonebreakers databases by optimising collection, organisation, queries, compressing methods and access of data.
