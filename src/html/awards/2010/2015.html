                  <p>
                     In 2015 two people were awarded the Turing Award; Whithfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.
                     Bailey Whitfield DIffie was born on June 5<sup>th</sup>, 1944 and is an American cryptographer. Diffie graduated form the
                     Massachussetz Institute of Technology (MIT)in 1965. Martin Edward Hellman was born on Octiber 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1945 and conducted
                     his studies at New York University in electrical engineering. In 1976, DIffie and Hellman wrote <strong>
                     "New Directions in Cryptography"</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     They got awarded because theire work introduced the ideas of <em>public key Cryptography</em> and <em> digital signatures </em>.
                     They have been also able to solve the problem of exchanging keys between two parties.
                  </p>

               <h3> What is Cryptography? </h3>
                  <p>
                      Cryptography is the field of cryptology that deals with the subject of "hidden writings".
                      More precisely, ir deals with making certain wiritngs unreadbale to unauthrized persons,
                      thus ensuring the requirement of confidentziality and <em> computer security </em>.
                  </p>
                  <br>
               <h3> Public-Key Cryptography </h3>
                  <p>
                     <strong> Public key cryptography </strong> is also known as <strong> asymmetric cryptography</strong>,
                     or <strong> key pair cryptography</strong>.
                     In this type of hidden communication, a key pair i sassigned to each party involved in the communication:
                     <ul>
                        <li> public key, which must be publicly distributed </li>
                        <li> private key, which is a personal key and must be kept secret </li>
                     </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The operation of thi mechanism is based on the idea that if one key takes care of encrypting the code or message,
                     the other takes care of decrypting it.
                     Specifically, anyone can encrypt a message with the recipient's public key,
                     but only the recipient can decrypt the message with his private key.
                  </p>
                  <br>
               <h3> Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h3>
                   <p>
                     Diffie and Hellman's publication was the first research that proposed the creation of a public key and a
                     corresponding pirvate key. One of the first public-key protocols is indeed name after Diffie and Hellman;
                      i.e. <strong>Diffie-Hellman key exchange</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Traditionally, two people that wanted who wanted to communicate securely had to first exchange keys phsyically
                     and securely.
                     The protocol suggested by Diffie and Hellman creates a shared secret between two parties, which allows confidential
                     communication over a non-secure (public) network.
                  </p>
                  <br>
               <h3> Basic Concept of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange </h3>
                  <details>
                  <p>
                     To explain the basic idea behind this cryptographymethod we will use as an example two subjects, i.e. Alice and Bob,
                     and instead of using numbers we will use colors:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <ul>
                        <li> first of all Alice and Bob must agree on a color (yellow) that remains public and must not be kept secret.</li>
                        <li>The second step consists on choosing two colors that both individuals must kepp secret; red for alice, and sea green for Bob.</li>
                        <li>The most important step in this encryption process occurs at this point: Alice and Bob must now mix the color
                            they have publicly agreed upon with the color they kept secret. Resulting in an orange for Alice and light blue for Bob.</li>
                        <li>At this point, Alice and Bob must send each other the resulting color form this mix.</li>
                        <li>Finally, they both have to mix the colors they received with their own private color.</li>
                        <li>The result is a "yellow-brown" color mix that is the same as the color the partner of the converstaion will get.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </p>
                  </details>

               <h3>The Concept of a Digital Signature</h3>
                  <p>
                     With their research named <em>"New Directions in Cryptography"</em> Diffie and Hellman also introduced the notion of a digital siganture
                     scheme. A digital signature is a mathematical method of guranteeing the authenticity of a message or document sent by a sender to an
                     intended recipient over a non secured communication channel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     This porcess is neacessary beacuse:
                     <ul>
                        <li>it makes possible to check that the sender of the message is actually who they say they are;</li>
                        <li>the sender cannot deny that it was him who sent the message/document;</li>
                        <li>the message is not modified in the path between the sender and the recipient.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </p>
