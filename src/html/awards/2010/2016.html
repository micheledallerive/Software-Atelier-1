        <h3> The World Wide Web</h3>
        <p>
         Timothy John Berners-Lee got awarded because he invented the WWW (World Wide Web).
          He is also credited as the inventor of the first web browser and for creating the algorithms that allow the Web to
          grow.
          Berners-Lee was born in London the 8<sup>th</sup> June of 1955, and he studied physics at the Queen's College of the
          University of Oxford.
          One important step in his life happened when he went to work at the CERN (Organisation européenne pour la recherche nucléaire) in 1980,
          where he had the opportunity to be a consultant in the software engineering department.
        </p>
        <p>
          The World Wide Web is one of the most popular internet services on the
          market and allows consumers to navigate a hugely vast assortment of content.
          The unique trait of the World Wide Web is that the content is connected through a system of links, which
          allows for an easy search of information.
        </p>

        <h3>The birth of the WWW</h3>
        <p>
          The basic idea of the World Wide Web was born in 1989 while Berners-Lee was working at CERN. The researcher
          observed how some colleagues from different departments were exchanging information through phone calls and
          visualizing pieces of information as videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the 12<sup>th</sup> March 1989, the English researcher presented to his supervisor a document through which
          he proposed the creation of a software
          whose purpose was to allow the exchange of scientific documentation in electronic format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, Tim Berners-Lee's initial goal was to make communication at CERN much easier and, therefore, to improve cooperation
          between different researchers.
        </p>
        <h3> Peculiarities of the World Wide Webv </h3>
        <p>
          The main characteristic of the World Wide Web is that the web pages are connected through links.
          Indeed, Berners-Lee wanted to escape the traditional way of classifying information, where documents were
          classified in a traditional and sequential manner.
          Instead, the English researcher intended to create a place where information is linked to each other. This
          method of cross-referencing allows for a much easier
          and intuitive search of information.
