               <br>
               <p>
                  In 2017, two people got awarded with the Turing Award; John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson.
               </p>
               <p>
                  John L. Hennessy was born the 22<sup>th</sup> September 1952. He has been able to accomplish multiple successes in his life:
                  he is a computer engineer, , a successful busisnessman; founder of MIPS 
                  Computer System Inc., which is now known as MIPS Technologies Inc, and he is the chairman of Alphabet Inc.
               </p>
               <p>
                  David Andrew Patterson was born the 16<sup>th</sup> November 1947, and is one of the pioneers of the <strong>RISC</strong> 
                  (<em>Reduced Instruction Set computers</em>) architecture and <strong>RAID</strong> (<em>Redundant Array of Independent Disks</em>) Technology.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The Two researchers won the Turing Award beacsuse of their work on a systematic and quantitative appraoch to computer design and its
                  evaluation.

               <h3> RISC design </h3>
               <p>
                  Due to their systematic and quantitative approach, Hennessy and Patterson managed to create micorprocessors that have the ability to 
                  make computers: faster, and less energy consuming.
                  The type of architecture proposed by the two researchers was named RISC and it allows a computer to execute a set of instructions faster 
                  than a <strong>CISC</strong> (<em>Complex Instruction Set Computer</em>) architecture.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The research conducted by Hennessy and Patterson heavily influenced today's chips architecture. Indeed, today, 99% of smartphones contain
                  micorprocessors based on the RISC architecture. For exmaple, Apples's iphone processors, as ell as Exynos models and Samsung's Qualcomm
                  chip have a RISC design.
               </p>

                  <p>
                     From the name, you might think that due to the reduction in instruction set, this type of design is disadvtangeous.
                     Nevertheless, <b>RISC</b> architecture has the ability to process data faster than the CISC design. This feature is due to the reason that many instructions
                     are not resident, but could be constituted by software programs or codes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Nowadays,  RISC technology could be the fastest and most efficient in the market.

               <details>
                  <summary> <strong>CISC</strong> </summary>
                 <p>
                    The <b> CISC </b> architecture relies on a large set of instructions, ranging form simple to very complex.
                    This type of micorprocessor is often used in intel's Pentium micorprocessors.
                    Although the RISC architecture allows for faster data computation, the CISC design also has advatnages:
                    <ul>
                       <li> it is easier to <i>add commands</i> into the chip,</li>
                       <li><i>high-level languages</i> easier are easier to design,</li>
                       <li> Arithmetic and logic computations can run on both memory and registers</li>
                    </ul>
                 </p>
               </details>
