               <p>
                   In 2018 the Turing Award went to three people: Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun.
                   <ul>
                      <li>Yoshua Bengio was born on the 5<sup>th</sup> of March 1964 in Paris and is a computer scientist. 
                           Bengio is a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal and his name is 
                           well established in the field of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>.</li>
                      <li>Geoffrey Everest Hinton was born on the 6<sup>th</sup> of December 1947 and is a Canadian computer scientist. 
                            Hinton is well known in the field of computer science due to his contributions to the development of 
                            <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>deep learning</strong>.</li>
                      <li> Yann LeCun was born on the 8<sup>th</sup> of July in Paris and is a researcher and computer scientist.
                   </ul>
                   The three researchers were awarded the Turing Award thanks to their research and engineering that have made deep neural 
                   networks a very important aspect of computing.

               <h3> Deep Neural Networks </h3>
               In traditional computers, there is a program that imposes very specific instructions on the computer on how to perform certain computations. 
               Whereas, a computer that makes use of <strong> deep learning</strong> (which is a subcategory of Artificial Intelligence), does 
               not obey to a step-by-step set of instructions to perform certain functions. Rather, the computer uses an algorithm that allows it to extrapolate 
               tendecies from the input data, in order to relate it to the output data. For example the computer can relate the pixels of an image (i.e. input data) to the keyword "cat".
               <p>
                 <q>Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,</q>
                 as said by Cherri M. Pancake., the president of ACM.
               </p>

                  In recent years, Deep neural networks is the field of artificial intelligence that is most responsible for the progress in Computer Science.
                  Particularly, the innovations brought by this branch are numerous, especially as regards the following:
                  <ul>
                     <li>computer vision;</li>
                     <li>speech recognition;</li>
                     <li>and natural language understanding.</li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
