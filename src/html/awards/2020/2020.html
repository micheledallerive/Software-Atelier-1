               <h3>Books in algorithms and compilers</h3>
                  <p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has named Alfred Vaino Aho and Jeffrey David Ullman 
                      recipients of the 2020 ACM A.M. Turing Award. They were recognized for such award due to their seminal work in 
                      compilers and algorithms and their lasting influence on the field through the textbooks they wrote together, which shaped generations of students.
                  </p>
                  <h3> Why they got the award </h3>
                     <p>
                        not a lot of people outside the field of computer science know that wheb a computer program is written in a language humans understand, 
                        such as C++, it must then be translated to a lower-level language that machines understand. such ignorance is what made them win the award.
