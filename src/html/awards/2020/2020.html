                     The ACM has declared Aho and Ullman receivers of the A.M. Turing Award in 2020. They have been diagnosed for such award because of their seminal paintings in  compilers and algorithms and their lasting have an impact on on the sector via the textbooks they wrote collectively, which formed generations of college students.

                        no longer numerous humans outdoor the field of computer technology know that wheb a computer software is written in a language humans recognize,
                        along with C++, it must then be translated to a decrease-stage language that machines apprehend. such lack of knowledge is what made them win the award.
