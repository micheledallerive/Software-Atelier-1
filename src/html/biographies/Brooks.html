               <h2 class="subtitle">Biography</h2>
               <p>Frederick Phillips Brooks Jr. born in 1931 is an American computer architect, computer scientist and software engineer mostly known for his managing of development of IBM's System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software support package. Brooks Jr earned his Bachelor’s degree in physics from Duke University, to pursue his PHD in applied mathematics or computer science from Harvard University, supervised by Howard Aiken.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p> At the age of 25, Brooks Jr. joined IBM to work on the IBM 7030 Stretch, a scientific supercomputer that was valued at $10 million, and other big projects that led him to become the manager for the development of the IBM System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software package. During this time he coined the term "computer architecture". Brooks was invited to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1964, and later became the founder of the University’s computer science department, developing and contributing to the university for twenty years. He wrote multiple books about his work experience managing software projects and the difficulties he faced working in software. Brooks stated multiple times that his single most important decision was the change of the IBM 360 series from a 6-bit byte to an 8-bit byte, which let to the enablement of the lowercase letters. That change propagated everywhere. His numerous projects and achievements earned him multiple awards, from the Turing Award in 1999, to the Computer Pioneer Award, IEEE Computer Society in 1982 and many more.
