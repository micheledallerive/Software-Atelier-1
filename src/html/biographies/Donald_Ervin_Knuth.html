               <p>Donald Ervin Knuth  is an American computer scientist, mathematician, and professor emeritus at Stanford University born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and from the beginning of his studying career, he was a student which always thought of ingenious ways to solve problems.
 Knuth started studying  physics to the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, enrolling in 1956. While studying Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, which was the first mass produced computer in the world.
Using his ingenious ways to solve problems, after reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he thought he could have done it better.
He received two degrees from Case in 1960: his bachelor of science degree, and a master of science by a special award of the faculty, who considered his work exceptionally great.
He also wrote a book of 6 volumes :the art of computer programming  published in 1968, at the beginning he wrote just 1 volume, but he realised it wasnâ€™t enough to explain all he wanted to.
Just before publishing the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth left Caltech (California Institute of Technology)to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division, then situated on the Princeton University campus, which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p>In 1974 he won the most important price : the Turing Award.
Knuth received it for contributing to analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, but particularly the price has been given to Knuth for his most significant contributions to the "art of computer programming" through his series of well-known books.
The collections of technique, algorithms, and relevant theory in these books have served as a focal point of influence on computer science.

Given the many awards received, and all the work done in influencing computer science, knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms".
