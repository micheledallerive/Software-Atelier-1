               <p>Douglas Carl Engelbart (1925-2013) was an inventor and a computer engineer. Born in Oregon, Poland, he graduated from Oregon State University with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. Engelbart served the Unites States Navy for two years, working as a radar technician in World War II. After being hired by the Ames Research Center, located in California, he decided to pursue his studies at the University of California, obtaining a a doctorate in electrical engineering, and later on hired as the Stanford Research Institute, also known as SRI International.

               <p> 
                In 1963 SRI partially funded Engelbart’s own research laboratory, the Augmentation Research Center, where he worked on inventing and perfecting various devices for inputting, manipulating, and displaying data. Engelbart wanted to find a way to use computers to connect individuals in a network that would allow them to share and update information in “real time”. He combined his past experiences working as a radar technician with groupware or software, to help him with his goal. He ended up inventing the computer mouse, the multiple-window display, and hypermedia, which is the linking of texts, images, videos and sound files within a single document. 
                His inventions made computers accessible for ordinary people. Engelbert was awarded multiple prizes and awards for his innovations and successes.
