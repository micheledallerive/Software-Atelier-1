        <h2 class="subtitle">Biography and Career</h2>
        <p> Bob Floyd was born in New York in 1936. He was recognized as a prodigy when he was 6, and in fact was a very bright child,  so that he finished high school at the age of 14. He was later admitted into a a special program for gifted children and he later received a Bachelor of Arts in liberal arts in 1953 at the age of only 17, and a second bachelor's degree in physics in 1958. His passion for computers came when he became a staff member of the Armour Research Foundation at Illinois Institute of Technology in the 1950s. In the 1960s he became a computer operator, and later a programmer by teaching himself from manuals and he started to publish many papers from radio interference to compilers. He was credited with creating the field of programming language semantics. by the time he was 27 he became an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University and about six years later, in 1968 he started to work as an associate professor at Stanford University even without a P.h.D. degree, thanks to the strong collaboration with Knuth that helped Floyd by sponsoring his application. He was then promoted to full professor in 1970 and became chair of the Department of Computer Science in 1973.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          During his life he developed many important algorithms, for example for computing the median of the datas and the known Floyd-Steinberg algorithm, which is capable of rendering gray scale images with binary pixels using error diffusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Floyd as written above worked closely with Donald Knuth, with which became friend. He was the major reviewer of Knuth’s seminal work “The Art of Computer Programming“ thus being the person most cited in the work.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Award</h2>
        <p>
          His career earned him the Turing Award in 1978 for (cited) "having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of parsing, the semantics of programming languages, automatic program verification, automatic program synthesis, and analysis of algorithms".
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Death</h2>
        <p>
          He was forced to retire in 1994 after he was diagnosed with Pick’s disease, a neurodegenerative disease that began to compromise his physical and mental abilities. In a few years the illnes got worse enough to make him unresponsive to the point of his death in 2001.
          Shortly before retiring he published the book “The Language of Machines: An Introduction to Computability and Formal Languages”, in collaboration with his colleague Richard Biegel.
