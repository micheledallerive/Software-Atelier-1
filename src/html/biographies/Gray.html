               <p>Jim Nicholas Gray (1944-2012) was an American computer scientist, receiving the Turing Award in 1998 for “for seminal contributions to database and transaction processing research and technical leadership in system implementation”. After earning his Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering Mathematics from the University of Berkley, Gray started his journey by working as a researcher and software designer in several big industrial companies such as IBM, DEC etc. He later on joined Microsoft where he worked on TerraServer-USA and Skyserver. Jim Gray worked on several different projects that led to big achievements.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p> One of his biggest achievements is ACID ; a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite having errors, power failures or other obstacles. This work that was later on developed by others and had heavily influenced many aspects of development in database systems. Gray also worked on the MGL, or the multiple granularity locking ; a locking method used in database management systems. Likewise, he took part in the developing of the OLAP cube the operator used for data warehouse, or the two-tier transaction commit semantics. These big achievements in data management and database systems led to Gray receiving multiple prestigious awards in computer science, of which the Babbage Award. Each year, Microsoft Research presents the Jim Gray eScience, named after their former employee, to a researcher who has made an outstanding contribution to the field of data-intensive computing.
