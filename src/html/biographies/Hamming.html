               <p> Richard Hamming was born 11 Febuary 1915 in Chicago and he passed away in 1998 Monterey.
                 He attended the University of Chicago, in which he got in 1937 his Bachelor in Science degree.
                 After, he went to the University of Nebraska, where in 1939 he got his Master, while in 1942 he got
                 his PHD and became an instructor at the University of Illinois. <br>
                 After the war break out, he then joined the Manhattan Project.
                 However, in 1946 he left to join Bell Telephone Laboratories.
                 In 1968, he was the third person to receive the Turing Award, in recognition of his contributions on numerical methods,
                 automated coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes.
                 In 1976, he retired and started working as an adjunct professor in computer science.
               <h2 class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <ul>
               <li>Hamming is one of the founders of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).</li>
               <li>Since computers can occasionally make errors due to voltage spikes, there was a need to guard against these errors.
                   For that reason, Hamming devised an elegant way of constructing an error-correcting code, that is the Hamming code.
                   He also defines the Hamming Distance of a code, which describes its error detection and error correction capabilities.</li>
               <li>Hamming also worked on a vacuum tube computer with a drum memory, which his work resulted in the creation of a simple programming language.</li>
