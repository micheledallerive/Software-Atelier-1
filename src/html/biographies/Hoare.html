                <h2 class="subtitle">Biography</h2>
                <p>Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare, born 11th January 1934, is a British computer scientist.
                    He was born in Colombo, Ceylon, now called Sri Lanka. His father was a colonial civil servant and
                    his mother was the daughter of a tea planter. His education started in the “Dragon School, Oxford
                    '', then he moved to the “King’s School, Canterbury”. Then he studied classics and philosophy at
                    “Merton College, Oxford ''. After graduating the served 18 months in the National Service where he
                    learned russian. After his service he came back to school where he got a postgraduate certificate in
                    statistics. He then went to Moscow where he studied machine translation under Andrei Kolmogorov.
                    <br>
                    In the 60’s he left the Soviet Union to return to the United Kingdom, where he began working for a
                    small computer manufacturing company in London, The Elliott Brothers Ltd, where he implemented the
                    language ALGOL 60 and began developing major algorithms. After that he became a member of the
                    International Federation for Information Processing aroup 2.1 which specified, maintains and
                    supports the languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68. <br>
                    He became the professor of computing science at the “Queen’s University, Belfast” in 1968 and in
                    1977 he came back to Oxford as professor of computing and to lead the Programming Research Group.

                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle">Research</h2>
                <p>Some of his most significant works are: his sorting algorithms (Quicksort and Quickselect), Hoare
                    logic, the formal language Communicating sequential processes (CSP) used to specify the interactions
                    between concurrent processes, structuring computers operating system using the monitor concept and
                    the axiomatic specification of programming language. </p>
                <p>
                    He won the Turning award in 1980; “For his fundamental contributions to the definition and design of
                    programming languages.”
