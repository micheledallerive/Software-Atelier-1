               <h2 class="subtitle">Biography</h2>
               <p>James Hardy Wilkinson was born in Strood on the 27th of semptember of the 1919 and died in Teddington on the 5th of october of the 1986 

                  Recieved the Turing Award in the 1970 for his studies in numerical analysis, in order to be able to use high-speed digital computer. He is known for his research in computation of linear algebra and “backward” error analysis.  
                  
                  He was a british matematician an became an expert in a new field, born after World War II; numerical linear algebra.  
                  
                  Already as a kid, James showed a great intrest in mathematics and as he got  eleven years old, recieved a Foundation scholarship to the Sir Joseph Williamson’s Mathematical school. 
                  
                  Wilkinson managed to graduate from a Trinity College in Cambridge. 
                  
                  He was a great student and was expected to continue work with mathematic, but the beginning of World War II ended this plan. 
                  
                  He started working at the British Government MInistry of Supply, by researching thermodynamics, explosion and other belligerant possible topics. 
                  
                  After the war, he choosed not to return to Cambridge, but to join the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where he was able to work with Alan Turing to build an electronic computer. When Turing left the project, Wilkinson was left in charge of the development of the Pilot ACE. 
                  
                  One year after his death also received the Chauvenet prise.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p>Wilkinson's numerical analysis, uses numerical approximation to solve problems in mathematical analysis. Numerical analysis is used extensively in engineering and physics, and today it is also used in the social sciences and medicine. Thanks to the current computing power, it is possible to use numerical analysis in a more complex way, managing to create detailed mathematical models.
                  Through numerical analysis it is possible to calculate ordinary differential equations, celestial mechanics, stochastic differential equations and numerical linear algebra of data analysis.
                  Before modern powerful computer, people used to use hand interpolation formulas, by receiving data from printed tables.
