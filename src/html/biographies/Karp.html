                <p>Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1935, Richard Manning Karp he was the oldest of four siblings. Both
                    of his parents were graduates and both of them at Harvard, his father wanted to be a doctor but had
                    to change his plan because of the high fees that the school required. His mother got her degree at
                    the age of 57 after taking some evening courses. He, like his parents before, attended Harvard
                    University as well, where in 1955 he got his bachelor degree, in 1956 he got his master degree and
                    finally in 1959 he got his Ph.d in applied mathematics.
                    He then went working at IBM for a while, then in 1968 he bacame professor at the "University of
                    California, Berkeley" during this period the won the Turing Award for his reseach explanied in the
                    next section.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Research</h2>
                <p>Citing the official presentation of this award: <br>
                    "For his continuing contributions to the theory of algorithms including the development of efficient
                    algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of
                    polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most
                    notably, contributions to the theory of NP-completeness. Karp introduced the now standard
                    methodology for proving problems to be NP-complete which has led to the identification of many
                    theoretical and practical problems as being computationally difficult."
                </p>
                <p>
                    After contributing a lot in the field of algorithms he completely changed subject, moving into the
                    field of Computational Biology. Karp first examined physical mapping of genes, devising algorithms
                    to help determine the physical location of genes in a genome given the limited indirect experimental
                    information about gene location. Such algorithms were incredibly important before affordable full
                    DNA sequencing became available.
