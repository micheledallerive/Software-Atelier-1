               <p>Alan Kay, (1940 -) is an American computer scientist born and raised in Massachusetts. Kay graduated from the University of Colorado with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1966 and a doctorate in computer science from the University of Utah in 1969. He joined the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and was mostly interested by the use of children for computers. Kay also worked on developing a programming language named “Smalltalk” for educational applications, to later on get hired at Apple Inc. where he designed a graphical user interface for operating systems (OS).

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p>
                While studying, he worked on FLEX, a small computer which led him to divise the DynaBook ; a concept for a small tablet-style computer with a flat screen. He was never able to build one but his work and ideas around the DynaBook later found fruition in laptops and tablets. Kay contributed to the development of Ethernet, laser printing, client-server architecture and many other projects which led to him being awarded multiple honors and awards, such as the Kyoto Prize, the Charles Stark Draper Prize etc.
