                    throughout the 1960s, Lampson and others had been part of venture GENIE at UC Berkeley. In 1965, numerous task GENIE participants, mainly Lampson and Peter Deutsch, developed the Berkeley Timesharing device for clinical information systems' SDS 940 laptop. After completing his doctorate, Lampson stayed on at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor (1967-1970) and partner professor (1970-1971) of laptop technological know-how. For a time period, he concurrently served as director of system development for the Berkeley laptop organisation (1969-1971).
                    In 1971, Lampson became one of the founding members of Xerox PARC, wherein he worked inside the pc science Laboratory (CSL) as a most important scientist (1971-1975) and senior studies fellow (1975-1983). His now-famous imaginative and prescient of a personal computer become captured inside the 1972 memo entitled "Why Alto?". In 1973, the Xerox Alto, with its 3-button mouse and complete-web page-sized display, was born. it is now taken into consideration to be the very first non-public computer in phrases of what has grow to be the "canonical" GUI mode of operation.
                    all the subsequent computers constructed at Xerox PARC besides for the "Dolphin" (used inside the Xerox 1100 LISP system) and the "Dorado" (used within the Xerox 1132 LISP system) followed a widespread blueprint referred to as "Wildflower", written by using Lampson, and this covered the D-collection Machines: the "Dandelion" (used inside the Xerox big name and Xerox 1108 LISP gadget), "Dandetiger" (used within the Xerox 1109 LISP gadget), "daybreak" (Xerox 6085), and "Dicentra" (used internally to govern diverse specialized hardware gadgets).
