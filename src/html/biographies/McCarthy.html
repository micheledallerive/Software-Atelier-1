               <p>
                John McCarthy was born the 4 September in 1927 in Boston and he He passed away in 2011 in Stanford, California.
                After having completed his studies in Belmont High School in Los Angeles, he studied mathematics at the California
                Institute of Technology, in which in 1948 he recived a BS in mathematics. After that he recived a PhD, also in
                mathematics, from Princeton University.<br>
                He worked briefly subsequently at Princeton, Stanford, Dartmouth and MIT.
                In the latter, he was working and was also the co-founder of Project MAC, that was a project on artificial intelligence.
                In 1962 he left MIT and He started his career as a professor in Stanford University.
                Here he created the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) and remained for the rest of his career, until his retirement in 2000.

               <h2 class="subtitle">Research</h2>
               <ul>
               <li>He was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence.
               In fact, in 1955 McCarthy invented the word "A.I" in connection with a projected summer
               workshop at Dartmouth College, which attracted many of the world's top computer scientists.</li>
               <li>He also created the programming language lisp in 1958 as part of improving his AI theories.
               McCarthy proposed timesharing as a way of distributing computer resources while at MIT, in which many
               individual users could appeared to have exclusive access to a costly mainframe computer system.</li>
              <li> In the 1960s and 1970s, timesharing became a popular computing paradigm, with MIT spearheading
               much of the early research, which was motivated by McCarthy's theories.</li>
               <li> In 1971 He won the ACM Turing Award, for his book "The Present State of Research on Artificial Intelligence".
               Later in 1988 he was also awarded the Kyoto Prize and the National Medal of Science (1990).</li>
