               <p>
                Allen Newell was born the 19 March in 1927 in San Francisco, passed away the 19 July in 1992 in Pittsburgh.
                was an informatic, psychologist, mathematician known to have won the 1975 Turing Award for is work in AI.
                Remembered as one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence after Alan Turing. His goal in life was to understand the
                cognitive architecture of the human brain and how it approaches problems to develop a program that simulated
                the human problem-solving attitude. </br>
                He enrolled at Standford succeeding majoring in physics in 1949,
                and the year after he graduated in mathematics at Princeton university in 1950.
                After the graduation, he joined the RAND corporation in Santa Monica where he worked and knew
                Joseph Kruskal for the logistic of the United States Air Force. </br>
                This because he thought that he would prefer experimental and theoretical research to pure mathematics.
                He also got his PhD from the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon. During this period Allen continued to work for the RAND corporation. </br>
                In 1952, Newell met Herbert Simon, with him Newell shared same interest in problem-solving, simulations and other topics.
                They worked together until 1958. </br>
                Newell separated from Simon, and he worked on the project “soar”
                from the 70s until his death in 1992. </br>
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p>
                 The Period at RAND corporation made Newell creating two new theories:
                 A Model for Organization Theory and Formulating Precise Concepts in organization
                 theory applying game-theoretic methods to organization theory.  </br>
                 In 1952, always at RAND corporation he, with John Kennedy and Bob Chapman,
                 created the first simulator capable of analyzing the interactions in the passenger compartment of the plane.
                 in this studies Newell was thinking about the fact that the "information processing” must be the central activity of the organization. </br>
                 In 1955 Newell with Simon made the Logic Theorist program, the first AI program and in 1958 always with Herbert they made the General Problem Solver (GPS).
                 In the same years they developed list-processing language, a programming language. Some basics of this language were incorporated in John McCarthy’s LISP.
