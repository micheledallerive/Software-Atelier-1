               <p>
                 Ivan Edward Sutherland, age 83, was born in Hasting, Nebraska (US), on the 16th May 1938.
                 In 1959 he received his Bachelor of Science Degree from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in
                 electrical engineering. In 1960 he obtained his Master of Science Degree at the Caltech and in 1963
                 he was awarded his Ph.D. in EECS from MIT.  In 1966, he also received an honorary Master Degree of
                 Arts from Harvard University in 1966.
                 <br>
                 After his Ph.D. Sutherland served as military officer in the U.S Army commission, where he was
                 assigned as an electrical engineer. In 1964 he became head of the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced
                 Research Project Agency's (DARPA) Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). Here he managed a
                 yearly budget of 15 million USD for computer research in time-sharing and artificial intelligence.
                 <br>
                 From 1965 to 1978 Sutherland was an academic at various universities. From 1965 to 1968, he was an
                 Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at Harvard University, where he developed the
                 Cohen–Sutherland computer graphics line clipping algorithm. In 1968 he created the first virtual
                 reality and augmented reality in collaboration with his student Sproull. From 1968 to 1974 Sutherland
                 was a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah.
                 <br>
                 In 1968 Sutherland and David C. Evans founded Evans & Sutherland where they were the leading experts
                 in the field of real-time hardware 3D computer graphics, and printer languages.
                 <br>
                 From 1974 to 1978 Sutherland was the founding head of the Computer Science department at California
                 Institute of Technology, and then, in 1980, he started a consulting firm under the name “Sutherland,
                 Sproull and Associates”.
                 <br>
                 His other important findings are the characterization and categorization of hidden surface algorithms
                 (1974), the Trojan Cockroach, a machine with 6 legs that could walk around (1983), and most
                 importantly the Sketchpad, the first interactive computer-graphics program, for which he won the
                 Turing Award. For more information about his Turing award  follow the link below.
