               <p>Niklaus Emil Wirth, born 15 February 1934 in Winterthur, is a Swiss computer scientist.
                In 1959 he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electronic engineering at the “Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich” ( ETH Zürich). In 1960 he got a Master of Science from the “ Université Laval, Canada”, after that in 1963 he was awarded a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the “University of California, Berkeley”. <br>
                From 1963 to 1967 he was an assistant professor at the “Stanford University” and at the “ETH Zürich”. From 1968 to 1999 he was a professor of informatics at the “ETH Zürich”. <br>
                He had also worked for the IFIP (International Federation for Information Processing) where he developed some international standards in programming and informatics. He was also in a group in charge of maintaining and supporting the programming language ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p>He won the Turing Award in 1984 for: <br>
                “Developing a sequence of innovative computer languages”
                He developed 5 major language in just 22 years and in order they are Euler (1965), ALGOL W (1966), Pascal (1970), Modula (1975) and Oberon (1987). <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Euler is born as an extension and generalization of ALGOL 60 with the goal of:
                Benign simple yet more flexible, Useful, Process with reasonable efficiency, Definable with rigorous formality. <br>
                ALGOL W was the successor of ALGOL 60, it was pretty simple in fact it added some data types, introduced the while statement and replaced the switch with the case statement. <br>
                Then he built Pascal which is an imperatve and procedural programming language, this language was designed to encurage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. <br>
                 Modula is then a descendant of Pascal, its main innovation is a module system, used for grouping set of related declaration into a single program unit. <br>
                 Last but not least we have Oberno which was the last programming language in the ALGOL-like family of programming language. Oberon was developed with the idea of increasing the power of Modula-2 but at the same time decreasing its complexiy.
