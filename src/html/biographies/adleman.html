               <h2 class="subtitle">Biography</h2>
               <p>Leonard Adleman is an American computer scientist and cryptographer, also known as father of DNA computing, born 
                   in December 31, 1945 in San Francisco, California, U.S. He is one of the three cowinners of the Turing Award in 2002, 
                   along with <a href="html/biographies/rivest.html">Rivest</a> and <a href="html/biographies/shamir.html">Shamir</a>. They have been rewarded for their patented “Cryptographic Communication System and Method”, 
                   or RSA encryption.<br/> He is also well known for the invention of the subject area of DNA Computing. 
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Career and Research</h2>
               <p>Adleman received its bachelor in mathematics in 1068 from the University of California, Berkeley. His Ph.D. degree has 
                   been earned in EECS in 1976. <br/>
                He is a member of the National Accademy of Sciences and in 1996 he became member of the National Academy of Engineering 
                and helps developing the theory of computation and cryptography. <br/> 
                He taught mathematics at MIT from 1976 to 1980 and then scomputer science in the University of Southern California. <br/>
                In 1994 he released his paper describing the use of DNA as a computational system. His paper was successfully showing the 
                use of DNA to compute an algorithm and to have the potential to solve large-scale search problems. <br/>              
                He also helped discover the Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test. <br/>               
                In his paper, in 1984 he conied the term of “Computer Virus”. <br/>
                Along with the Turing Award he also has been rewarded by the Paris Knellakis Theory and Practice Award and the American 
                Academy of Arts and Sciences.
