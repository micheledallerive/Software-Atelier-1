               <p>Charles William Bachman III was born 11th December 1924 in Manhattan, Kansas. <br>
                 He attended high school in East Lansing (Michigan), where his father, Charles Bachman II, was working as football coach at Michigan State College.<br>
                 During the WWII he served in the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Corps in the South West Pacific Theater where he learned to use fire controls computers for aiming 90mm guns.<br>
                 During his life, he has been an analyst, an architect, developer and entrepreneur in computer software, well known for his invention of the first random access database management system.

               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Timeline</h2>
               <p>After the end of the war, in 1948, Bachman graduated at Michigan State College with a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering.<br>
                 In 1950 he went to work for Down Chemical, where, using mechanical punched-card computing devices, his job was to solve networks of simultaneous equations that represented data from Dow plants.<br>
                 In 1957 he became head of the Data Processing Department through which he founded the Share Data Processing Committee<br>
                 In 1960 he joined General Electrics in New York. He was in charge of testing designs to automate factory planning scheduling, operational control, and inventory control in New York.
                 The resulting MIACS was based on the Integrated Data Store and Bachman's concept of an "information inventory". It was the first to adopt a new model called "network data model" in which the system supports and enforce relationships between various records.<br>
                 In 1964 he moved to the Computer Department of General Electrics where he helped to create the WEYCOS 2, another management information system.<br>
                 In 1973 he received the Turing Award for contributions to the tehcnology of databases<br>
                 In 1983 he founded Bachman Information System which built computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools that automated the design and publication of Bachman diagrams and generated database schemas through forward and reverse engineering.<br>
                 In 2014 Bachman was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by Barack Obama.<br>
                 He died in 2017 due to Parkison.
