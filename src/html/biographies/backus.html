               <h2 class="subtitle">General</h2>
               <p>John Backus was  born in 1924 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
                 Backus was the inventor of  Fortan  and in 1977 he received the
                 Turing Award for his use of high-level programming in Fortan.
                 Additionally he  invented the Backus-Naur form, a notation of
                 formal  language syntax.
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Contributions</h2>
               <p>John Backus struggled with his studies in high school and even
                 more at university where he attended in Virginia and studied
                 Chemistry. After that he was enlisted in the army and served in
                 WW2. His performance at the army tests were exceptional and thus
                 he was sent by the army to study engineering at the University
                 of Pittsburgh.
                 <br>
                 Backus continued to study medicine but inevitably quit. During
                 that time John Backus was diagnosed with a cranial bone tumor
                 which was successfully removed. His medical studies allowed him
                 to design a plate to substitute the one that was placed on his
                 head after the tumor removal operation. For this achievement
                 Backus received an honorable medical discharge from the U.S.
                 Army in 1946.
                 <br>
                 In 1949 he  graduated from  Columbia University with a degree
                 in Mathematics and one year later with a master degree in
                 Mathematics as well.
                 <br>
                 In 1950 Backus joined IBM and started working on a program that
                 would calculate positions of the moon.
                 <br>
                 In 1953 Backus created a high-level programming language for
                 IBM called Speedcoding. It supported software for the IBM 701.
                 John Backus was very involved in the creation of ALGOL 58 and
                 later ALGOL 60. He developed the Backus-naur form (BNF) which
                 was the global notation used for grammar-free and context-free
                 programming language. This contributed heavily in the creation
                 of compilers. The BNF also contributed to the Turing Award.
                 His next project was developing functional-programming (FP) as
                 a way to deviate from the Von  Neumann programming style.
                 Nevertheless it was not received well, as people viewed  it
                 like traditional functional programming.
                 <br>
                 Backus later developed the successor of FP, FL (Function Level)
                 which was an IBM project involving members from all over the
                 world. FL  stayed inside IBM and stopped development after the
                 project was complete. Documents were not made public as FL was
                 not fully compatible with functional programming languages of
                 the time.
                 <br>
                 John Backus died in 2007 at the age of 82 in  Oregon.
