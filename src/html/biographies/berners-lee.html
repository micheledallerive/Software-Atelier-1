               <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee born in London, England on June 8, 1955. He is a well-known British computer
                scientist, famous for being the inventor of the World Wide Web (WWW). Currently a professor
                of Computer Science in both Universities of Oxford and at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology). <br/>
                He has been awarded by the Millennium Technology Prize by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation along
                the knighthood award by Queen Elizabeth II. His numerous other honors included the National Academy of
                Engineering’s prestigious Charles Stark Draper Prize in 2007, but Its Major achievement was the Turing Award,
                earned in 2016 for inventing the World Wide Web.
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Career and Research</h2>
               <p>Tim Berners-Lee’s parents were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer
                Ferranti Mark 1.  <br/>
                From 1973 to 1976 he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford achieving a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree
                in physics. He already had a lot of notions about computers, indeed, during his university studies he built
                a computer out of an old television bought from a repair shop. <br/>
                After its graduation he worked in the telecommunication sector as engineer in multiple companies. He covered
                multiple positions in different companies, in 1976 he designed computer software at Plessey Telecommunications
                Ltd. and in 1970 he worked for CERN in Geneva. While working at CERN he developed a program for himself with
                the capability of connecting multiple files via links (hypertext). Before returning to CERN in 1984, he worked
                from 1980 at John Poole's Image Computer Systems Ltd. where he kept designing computer systems. As he came back
                to CERN, he was introduced into the computer network’s laboratory, developing a way to allow computers to
                communicate each other and allow remote access. <br/>
                In 1989 he finally invented the first Web browser that, making use of the Internet, was able to create a global
                hypertext document system with the idea of making researchers able to share their work online without manually
                sharing each person, each project. His invention was made possible thanks to the already invented HTTP make it
                communicate with servers via Internet.  <br/>
                In 1993 Berners-Lee finally ended up conceiving the Web and in 1994 he officially established the World Wide
                Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Computer Science. In 1999 Berners-Lee becomes the first
                director of the company <i>3Com Founders</i>. <br/>
