               <br>
               <p>
          Manuel Blum, born in 26 April 1938, is a Venezuelan-American computer scientist and received the Turing Award in 1995 "In recognition of his contributions to the foundations of computational complexity theory and its application to cryptography and program checking".
<br>
He was born in a Jewish family in Venezuela and was educated at MIT, where he received his bachelor's degree and his master's degree in electrical engineering in 1959 and 1961 respectively.
Instead, in 1964, received his Ph.D. in mathematics by Marvin Minsky.
<br>
In him career he worked as a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley until 2001.
As for as 2018, he was the Bruce Nelson Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where his wife, Lenore Blum, was also a professor of Computer Science.
<br>
In 2002, he was also elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences.
Instead, in 2006, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to abstract complexity theory, inductive inference, cryptographic protocols, and the theory and applications of program checkers.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
<p>In the 60s he studied an axiomatic complexity theory which was independent of concrete machine models.
  <br>
   This theory is based on GÃ¶del numberings and the Blum axioms. Even though the theory is not based on any machine model it yields concrete results like the compression theorem, the gap theorem, the honesty theorem and the Blum speedup theorem.
<br>
Some of his other work includes a protocol for flipping a coin over a telephone, median of medians and the Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator, the Blum-Goldwasser cryptosystem, and more recently CAPTCHAs.
<br>
Blum is also known as the advisor of many prominent researchers.
