               <h2 class="subtitle">General</h2>
               <p>Edgar Codd was born in Fortuneswell,  England in 1923. He won
                 a Turing Award in 1981 for his work on relational models to aid
                 database management which was revolutionary.

               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Contributions</h2>
               <p>Codd studied mathematics and chemistry at Exeter College in
                 Oxford. After his studies he participated in WW2 as a pilot for
                 the Royal Air Force Coastal Command.
                 <br>
                  In 1948 Codd moved to the US to work as a mathematical programmer
                  at IBM. He worked there until 1980 but throughout the years
                  Codd moved to Ontario Canada in 1953, to Ann-Arbor  in 1957 and
                  then to San Jose in California in 1959.
                  <br>
                  While in IBM Codd worked on various projects, one of which won
                  him a Turing Award.
                  <br>
                  In Ann-Arbor, where he was doing his PhD at the university of
                  Michigan, he made his thesis about self-replication in cellular
                  automata contributing to the work of Von Neumann.
                  <br>
                  In San Jose, Codd worked on theories of data arrangement. His
                  paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"
                  explained all his ideas about relational models and how they
                  can be implemented for database management. IBM did not implement
                  his model until the customers pressured for implementations.
                  Nevertheless when IBM created the project System R which was
                  based on the ideas of Codd he put other people working on it
                  without the expertise of Cobb and the end product was very
                  different from Codd’s ideas. The project even used a different
                  language called SEQUEL which was non-relational opposite to
                  Alpha, Codd’s language.
                  <br>
                  Separately from the team, Codd worked on his own relational
                  model with the help of Christopher J. Date.
                  <br>
                  In the 80s where relational models were gaining traction, Codd
                  found problems of companies misusing the name relational models
                  and so as a response he wrote his 12 rules that explained what
                  constitutes as relational programming and what not.
                  <br>
                  After this, working at IBM became impossible so he left and
                  started his own company with Christopher Date and other computer
                  scientists.
                  <br>
                  Edgar Codd also coined the term Online Analytical Processing
                  alongside which he wrote a corresponding book, "twelve laws of online analytical processing".
                  <br>
                  For the last years of his  life Codd moved to his home in Florida,
                  where he died in 2003 from heart failure at the age of 79.
