               <p>Stephen Cook was born on December 14 in 1939 in Buffalo, New
                 York. With expertise in mathematics and computer science Cook
                 has made his contributions on complexity theory and its proof
                 for which he received a Turing Award in 1982. Currently, he is
                 a professor at the University of Toronto, in the Department of
                 Computer Science and Mathematics.
                </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Contributions</h2>
               <p>Cook studied mathematics at the University of Michigan and later
                 got his master’s and PhD from Harvard University.
                 <br>
                  In his PhD, Cook researched the complexity of function with main
                  focus on multiplication and in 1971 he wrote a paper with the
                  title "The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures”, where he
                  formalized the notion of polynomial-time reduction and NP-completeness.
                  Cook proved the existence of NP-complete by proving that the
                  Boolean Satisfiability Problem was NP-complete.
                  <br>
                  This theorem is known as the Coop-Levin theorem as it was also
                  proven by Leonid Levin in the Soviet Union.
                  <br>
                  In 1966 he became an assistant professor at Berkeley University
                  at the faculty of mathematics.
                  <br>
                  After he was denied reappointment in 1970, he went to the
                  University of Toronto and as an associate professor of the
                  Department of Computer Science and Mathematics. In 1985 he
                  became a Distinguished Professor.
                  <br>
                  In 1975 Cook published a paper named "Feasibly Constructive
                  Proofs and the Propositional Calculus" in which he introduced
                  the Equational Theory PV, which aimed to formalize using polynomial-time
                  concepts in proofs.
                  <br>
                  In 1979 he formalized p-simulation and efficient propositional
                  proof systems in the paper "The Relative Efficiency of Propositional
                  Proof Systems" that was copublished with one of his students,
                  Robert A. Reckhow.
                  <br>
                  In 1982 Cook won the Turing Award for his theory of complexity.
                  He received multiple medals for his contributions as well as
                  being appointed a Fellow for the Royal Society of London, Royal
                  Society of Canada and ACM.
                  <br>
                  In 2015, Cook was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.
