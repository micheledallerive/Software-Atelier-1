               <p>Edsger Dijkstra was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1930.
                 He specialized in mathematics, physics and programming allowing
                 him to create groundbreaking theories. Dijkstra got his Turing Award
                 in 1972 for inventing structured programming.
                 <br>
                 Structured programming revolutionized programming and made it
                 accessible to the wider population. It used terms like if, then, else,
                 while and for to make the program codes more ordered and easy to read by
                 improving its quality.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Contributions</h2>
                 <p>Edsger W. Dijkstra studied mathematics and physics at the
                   University of Leiden. In 1952, Dijkstra became Netherlandâ€™s
                   first programmer.
                   <br>
                   Dijkstra finished his PhD at the University of Amsterdam on the
                   topic of 'Communication with an Automatic Computer' in which he
                   explained the use of Assembly which was used on the first commercial
                   computer, the Electrologica X1.
                   <br>
                   For ten years, starting in 1952 he worked Mathematisch Centrum
                   alongside  Bram Jan Loopstra and Carel S. Scholten in order to
                   build a computer. Dijkstra was the one who would write the
                   software for the machine. In 1960 he and his colleague  Jaap
                   Zonneveld developed the first compiler for ALGOL 60.
                   <br>
                   In 1962 Dijkstra became a professor at the Eindhoven University
                   of Technology for the faculty of Mathematics and later built a
                   team of programmers. With that group he created THE Operating
                   System (THE OS) which was a computer operating system.
                   <br>
                   In 1971 Dijkstra became a member of the Royal Netherlands
                   Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Fellow of the British
                   Computer Society. One year later he won the Turing Award.
                   <br>
                   In 1973 Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation and in his years
                   of research there he wrote approximately 500 documents.
                   <br>
                   From 1984 till his retirement Dijkstra taught at the
                   University of Texas in Austin. He retired in 1999 and
                   returned to the Netherlands to die peacefully after a long
                   battle with cancer.  Dijkstra died in 2002.
                   <br>
                   Naming all the fields in which Dijkstra contributed is futile
                   as they consist of most fields of software engineering.
