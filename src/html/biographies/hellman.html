               <p>Martin Hellman is born on October 2nd, 1945 in New York, U.S. in a Jewish family. He is well known for being
                   an American cryptologist, in particular for its public key cryptography cooperation with
                   <a href="html/biographies/diffie.html">Whitfield Diffie</a> and Ralph Merkle.
                   <br/>Hellman always worked for computer privacy and cryptography and for nuclear deterrence risk analysis too.
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Career and Research</h2>
               <p>Hellman graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and got his Bachelor degree in electrical engineering from
                   the University of New York. There he knew Feistel who introduced him to cryptography. In Standfort University he got
                   his Ph.D and then he worked in the electrical engineering department at MIT from 1969 to 1971’ Later he joined Standfort
                   University in the same department as assistant, after twenty-five years he finally became a full-time professor. <br/>
                The famous Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, New Directions in Cryptography got published in 1976. The paper introduced a
                radical new method of distributing cryptographic keys, granting secure transactions, communications or any online interaction
                granting a different level of privacy and security. Although Hellman debated the name of their Diffie-Hellman key exchange
                should be called Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange, Merkle’s contribution has never been considered as important as Hellman’s
                and Whitfield’s.  Hellman and Diffie’s public key cryptography work, as long as their contribution in making cryptography an
                area of academic research, were awarded the Marconi Fellowship and accompanying prize in 2000. In 2015 they finally got the Turing
                Award. Before that he also was awarded The Franklin Institute’S Louis E. Levy Medal, IEEE Donald G. Fink Prize Paper Award,  IEEE
                Information Theory Society for Technological Innovations and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal.<br/>
                As described before, Hellman also contributed to the development of computer privacy debate. Both him and Diffie, always criticized
                the short key size of the Data Encryption Standard in 1975 publicly for being such insecure and obsolete. They cooperated in
                inventing a 10.000$ brute force machine which could recover DES key in days. <br/>
                Hellman currently works in international security defusing the nuclear threat, calculating probabilities and risks associated with
                nuclear weapons. He began in 1980 working with scientists in the Soviet Union.
