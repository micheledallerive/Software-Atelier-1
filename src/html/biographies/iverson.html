               <h2 class="subtitle">General</h2>
               <p>Kenneth Eugene Iverson was born 17 December 1920 near Camrose in Canada, from farmers.<br>
                 After a simple education in his town, he stayed home to work on the farm helping his family, while studying calculus in the winter months.<br>
                 He served during the war for the Royal Canadian Air Force as flight engineer specializing in reconnaissance. During his military career he took some correspondence courses offered by the Canadian Legion to complete high school.<br>
                 He was a computer scientist noted for the development of APL and for his contributions in interface systems.<br>
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Timeline</h2>
               <p>In 1950 he graduated at Queen’s University in Ontario with a bachelor degree in mathematics and physics.<br>
                 In 1951 he graduated with a master degree in mathematics in Harvard, where his Ph.D. thesis was supervised by Professor Aiken, one of the inventors of Harvard MARK I.<br>
                 After completing his studies, Iverson joined the Harvard faculty to teach in Aiken’s new automatic data processing program, for one year as an Instructor, and for five years as an Assistant Professor.<br>
                 Under advicing of one of his professors (Frederick Brooks) he moved to Yorktown, New York, where he joined the new research centre of IBM.<br>
                 In 1962, Iverson published the book “A Programming Language” (which gave the idea for the name of APL programming language) which now is a classic for computer programming.<br>
                 In 1965 he wrote the first implementation for APL in Fortran for an IBM 7090 computer.<br>
                 In 1979 he won the Turing Award for his work with APL and for his contributions to the implementation of interactive systems, to educational uses of APL, and to programming language theory and practice.<br>
                 In 1980, Kenneth left IBM and moved back to Canada to work with I. P. Sharp.<br>
                 In 1987 he retired and turned his full attention to the development of a more modern dialect of APL.<br>
                 In May 1990 Iverson and Hui joined Iverson Software In 1990, which later became known as JSoftware.<br>
                 He died in 2004 in Toronto.
