               <p>
                  Donald Ervin Knuth is an american computer scientist and an important professor in Stanford University.
                  Knuth is known for being the author  of The Art of Computer programming, an important set of books that talks about algorithms and its analysis.
                  This collection of books is composed of  6 volumes,  published in 1968, at the beginning he wrote just 1 volume, but he realised it wasn’t enough to explain all he wanted to.
                  In 1978 Knuth is became the creator of Tex, a language suitable for writing informatic and mathematic texts.
                  Knuth is born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and he took his matematic degree at Case Institute of technology.
                  In 1963 Knuth, under the supervision of Marshal Hall, he got a doctorate in mathematics at California Institute of technology, were he began working as an associated.
                  While studying Knuth began working to the IBM 650, which was the first mass produced computer in the world.
                  Using his ingenious ways to solve problems, after reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he thought he could have done it better.
                  From 1992 Knuth become foreign partner of the Academie des sciences of Paris and in 2003 has been elected at Royal Society.
                  In 1992 Knuth withdrew from the regular commit of research to keep writing The Art of Computer Science, which in 2004 have been published the first three volumes.

               <p>The first three books that Knuth published had an important impact and helped many people to build knowledge on these books.
                  In 1974 Knuth has taken the A. M. Turing award for a big contribution on the field of design of programming languages and analysis of algorithms, and particularly for his important contributions to “The Art of Computer Programming” thanks to his collection of known books.
                  The collections of algorithms, technique and the most important theory in all the books served as an significant influence in computer science.
                  Given the many awards received, all the work done in influencing computer science, and his ingenious ways to solve problems, Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms".
