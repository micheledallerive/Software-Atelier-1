               <p>Leslie B. Lamport, born Febraury 7, 1941, New York, New York, is an American computer scientist.
                 He is best recognized for his seminal work in distributed systems and as the creator and author
                 of the original handbook for the document preparation system LaTeX. Lamport won the Turing Award
                 in 2013 <q><i>for fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of distributed and concurrent systems,
                 notably the invention of concepts such as causality and logical clocks, safety and liveness, replicated state
                 machines, and sequential consistency</i></q>. Lamport got the award during his time at Microsoft, making him the
                 fifth member of the Microsoft Research team to receive the honor.
