                 Leslie B. Lamport, born Febraury 7, 1941, New York, New York, is an American computer scientist.
                 He is best recognized for his seminal work in distributed systems and as the creator and author
                 of the original handbook for the document preparation system LaTeX. Lamport won the Turing Award
                 in 2013 <q><i>for fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of distributed and concurrent systems,
                 notably the invention of concepts such as causality and logical clocks, safety and liveness, replicated state
                 machines, and sequential consistency</i>.</q> Lamport was the fifth member of the Microsoft Research team to
                 receive the award during his tenure at the company.

                Massachusetts Computer Associates from 1970 until 1977. From 1977 to 1985, he worked at SRI International in Menlo Park, California,
                and then at Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center in Palo Alto, California, from 1985 until 2001. Lamport accepted
                a post as lead computer scientist at Microsoft Research in Mountain View, California in 2001.
