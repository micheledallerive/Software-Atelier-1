               <h2 class="subtitle">General</h2>
               <p>Marvin Lee Minsky was born in New York in 1927 from a Jewish family.<br>
                He attended Bronx High School of Science in New York and later. Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.
                He then served in the US Navy from 1944 to the end of WWII and, after that, he enrolled in 1946 at Harvard University to explore his scientific interests.<br>
                He contributed to several inventions, from the first head-mounted graphical display to the confocal microscope.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Timeline</h2>
               <p>In 1957 he moved to Boston, at the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to develop his interest in using computers to understand human mind.<br>
                 There, in 1959, Minsky confounded with John McCarthy (professor of electrical engineering at the MIT in that period)  the Artificial Intelligence Project.
                 The Artificial Intelligence Project quickly became an important centre of research and training for the nascent field of AI.<br>
                 In 1969 Minsky won the Turing Award for his central role in creating, shaping, promoting and advantancing the field of Artificial Intelligence.<br>
                 Marvin Minsky remained at the MIT for the rest of his academic career, becoming first Donner Professor of Science in 1974 and then Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Laboratory in 1990.<br>
                 In 1975 Minsky developed the concept of “frames”, very useful to identify precisely the general information that must be programmed into a computer before considering specific directions.<br>
                 Among his works we can find also The Society of Mind (1985) and The Emotion Machine (2006) in which Minsky presented his view of the mind and proposed theories about high-level human emotions<br>
                 Marvin Lee Minsky died in 2016 in Boston due to a cerebral hemorrhage.
