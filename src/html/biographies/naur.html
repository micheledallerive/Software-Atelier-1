               <p>
                 Peter Naur, a Danish astronomer and computer scientist, was born on October 25, 1928,
                 in Frederiksberg, Denmark, and died on January 3, 2016, in Herlev. For  <q>fundamental
                 contributions to programming language design and the definition of Algol 60, to compiler
                 design, and to the art and practice of computer programming</q>, he received the 2005 A.M.
                 Turing Award. Christiane Floyd, a computer scientist, was Naur's wife.
              </p>
              <h2 class="subtitle">Career and Research</h2>
              <p>
                Naur studied astronomy at Copenhagen University and completed his degree in two years rather than the usual five (1947-1949).
                After one year of military service, he continued his studies in England at the University of Cambridge (1950â€“51), where he worked with
                the EDSAC computer on astronomical calculations of comet and asteroidal orbits, and conducted more
                computer-assisted research in the United States. Naur then went to Denmark, where he worked as a
                scientific assistant at the University of Copenhagen's astronomical observatory from 1953 to 1959
                while studying for his PhD in astronomy.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Naur worked in the compiler design department at Regnecentralen, the first Danish computer
                 corporation, from 1959 to 1969, and taught courses at the Technical University of Denmark and
                 the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. He was the editor of the 1960 study
                 by an international group of computer scientists that defined <a class="link" href="html/awards/2000/2005.html">Algol 60</a>,
                 and he established the <i>Algol Bulletin</i> at Regnecentralen. In 1969, Naur was appointed as a
                 professor at the University of Copenhagen's Institute of Datalogy, from which he retired in 1998.
