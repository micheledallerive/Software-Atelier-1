               <h2 class="subtitle">Biography</h2>
               <p>Pearl is an Israeli-American computer scientist and philosopher. He was born September 4, 1936,
                 in Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine (present-day Israel). In 1956, Judea decided to study
                 engineering, after serving in the Israel Defense Forces and joining a kibbutz. In 1960 he received
                 a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Technion (Israel Institute of Technology)
                 where he met his wife, Ruth Pearl. He then moved to the United States to pursue his graduate studies.
               <br>Pearl attended Newark College of Engineering in 1961 where he received an M.S. in Electronics. In 1965
               he graduated with an M.S. in Physics from Rutgers University and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from
               the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. He started working on superconductive parametric amplifiers and
               storage devices at RCA Research Laboratories (now SRI International) in Princeton, New Jersey, and at
               Electronic Memories, Inc., on advanced memory systems. Later in 1970, he joined UCLAâ€™s School of Engineering
              where he started working on probabilistic artificial intelligence. Pearl is currently a professor of computer science
              and statistics and director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UCLA.
              <br>Judea Pearl is the father of journalist <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pearl" target="_blank">Daniel Pearl</a>, who was kidnapped and assassinated in
                  Pakistan in 2002 by terrorists linked to Al-Qaeda and the International Islamic Front because of his American
                  and Jewish ancestry.

               <h2  class="subtitle">Research</h2>
               <p>Judea Pearl is a pioneer of Bayesian networks and the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence,
                 as well as one of the first in the empirical sciences to mathematize casual modeling. His study aims to be
                 a high-level cognitive model as well. He is passionate about science philosophy, knowledge representation,
                 nonstandard logics, and education. UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf has referred to Pearl as "one
                 of the giants in the field of artificial intelligence." According to the Association for Computing Machinery, his
                 work on causation "revolutionized the concept of causality in statistics, psychology, medicine, and social sciences."
                 He received the ACM Turing Award in 2011 for his <q>fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the
                development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning</q>.
