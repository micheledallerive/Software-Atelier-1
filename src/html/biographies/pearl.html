               <p>
                 Pearl is an Israeli-American computer scientist and philosopher. He was born September 4, 1936, in Tel Aviv, British Mandate for
                 Palestine (present-day Israel). He is the father of journalist <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pearl" target="_blank">Daniel Pearl</a>,
                 who was kidnapped and assassinated in Pakistan in 2002 by terrorists linked to Al-Qaeda and the International Islamic Front because of his American
                 and Jewish ancestry.

               <p>
                 In 1956, Judea decided to study engineering, after serving in the Israel Defense Forces and joining a kibbutz. In 1960, he received
                 a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) where he met his wife, Ruth
                 Pearl. He then went to the US to pursue higher education. Pearl attended Newark College of Engineering in 1961 where he received
                 an M.S. in Electronics. In 1965, he graduated with an M.S. in Physics from Rutgers University and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from
                 the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. He started working on superconductive parametric amplifiers and storage devices at RCA Research
                 Laboratories (now SRI International) in Princeton, New Jersey, and at Electronic Memories, Inc., on advanced memory systems. Later in 1970,
                 he joined UCLAâ€™s School of Engineering where he started working on probabilistic artificial intelligence. Pearl is the director of UCLA's
                 Cognitive Systems Laboratory and a professor of computer science and statistics.

                 Judea Pearl was one of the first in the empirical sciences to mathematize casual modeling, as well as a pioneer of Bayesian networks
                 and the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence. His study aims to be a high-level cognitive model as well. He is passionate
                 about science philosophy, knowledge representation, nonstandard logics, and education. UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf has
                 referred to Pearl as <q><i>one of the giants in the field of artificial intelligence</i>.</q> According to the Association for Computing Machinery, his
                 work on causation <q><i>revolutionized the concept of causality in statistics, psychology, medicine, and social sciences</i>.</q>
