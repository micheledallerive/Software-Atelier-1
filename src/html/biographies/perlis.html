               <h2 class="subtitle">General</h2>
               <p>Alan Perlis was born in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, in 1922. His family was of Jewish descent.
                 He studied chemistry at the university of Carnegie Institute of Technology. It wasn’t until his service
                 at WW2 when he became interested in mathematics and later decided to pursue said field. In 1949 he
                 got a master’s and later a PhD in Mathematics at MIT. His  work was heavily based on integral equations
                 solved by iteration and analytic continuation
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Timeline</h2>
               <p>In 1952, he worked on the Whirlwind 1 project, which was developed at MIT. Whirlwind 1
                 was a vacuum-tube computer, one of the first computers to succeed in many fields. Fow example it was
                 the first to calculate in parallel and  use magnetic-core memory. It also succeeded in operating in
                 real time for a given output and it differed greatly from its predecessors.<br>
                 In 1955 he strived to build an IT compiler with a team at Purdue university in which he worked as head
                 of the computer lab.<br>
                 In 1956 Perlis moved to Carnegie where he was chair of the faculty of Mathematics and later became the first
                 head of Computer Science, and later president of the Association for  Computing Machinery. While in Carnegie he
                 started working with Joseph Smith, Harold van Zoernen, and Arthur Evans to build a succession of algebraic language
                 compilers and assemblers for the IBM-650.<br>
                 Alan Perlis is most known for his Turing award in 1966. He was the first to receive a Turing Award. The Award was for
                 his contribution on compiler construction, as indicated in his work on Internal Translator, written in 1956, and for
                 his role in the team that developed ALGOL. It was used in algorithm description for scientific texts and it later
                 influenced many languages to come like Simula, Pascal and C.<br>
                 In 1971 he became part of the Yale Computer Science department and held the position of chair. Later on in 1977 Perlis
                 became a member of the National Academy of Engineering.<br>
                 In 1982 Perlis wrote a collection of “slogans”, humorous statements revolving around computer programming called “Epigrams
                 for Programming”. It was published as an article in the SIGPLAN journal.
                 IN 1985 he won the Computer Pioneer Award, which was an award to honor people who had contributed to the advancement of the
                 computer industry.<br>
                 Alan Perlis stayed and worked at Yale until he passed away in 1990, at the age of 67.
