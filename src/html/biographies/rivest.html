               <h2 class="subtitle">Biography</h2>
               <p>Ronald L. Rivest born 6 of may, 1947 in Schenectady, New York, US, is an American computer scientist, 
                cryptographer and an institute professor at MIT. He is one of the three cowinners of the Turing Award in 
                2002, along with  <a href="html/biographies/adleman.html">Leonard M. Adleman</a> and <a href="html/biographies/shamir.html">Adi Shamir</a>. They have been rewarded for their patented “Cryptographic 
                Communication System and Method”, or RSA encryption. His work was basically about the discipline of algorithms and 
                combinatorics, cryptography, election integrity and machine learning. <br/>
                He is the inventor of symmetric key encryption algorithms Rivest Cipher: RC2, RC4, RC5, RC6; also known as 
                Ron’s Codes. <br/>
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Career and Research</h2>
               <p>Rivest got his bachelor’s degree in 1069 in mathematics, earned at Yale University. Later he got a doctorate 
                in 1974 in computer science from Standfort University, followed the attendance at MIT as member of Theory of 
                Computation Group, where he met <a href="html/biographies/adleman.html">Leonard M. Adleman</a> and <a href="html/biographies/shamir.html">Adi Shamir</a>. He also became the Viterbi Professor of Computer Science at 
                MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Three years later he produced his first public-key 
                encryption system using digital signatures. In 1983 they founded RSA Data Security and VeriSign, a digital 
                certification system on the Internet many people use to encrypt and secure mails and digital transactions. <br/>
                In 2006 Rivest published its ThreeBallot voting system which includes the ability for the voter to verify 
                that the vote gets properly recorded, respecting their privacy. <br/>
                Rivest has also been elected to numerous Awards along with Turing’s, such as the U.S National Academy of 
                Engineering, the U.S National Academy of Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery, the Institute of 
                Electrical and Electronics Engineers Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award and many more.
