               <h2 class="subtitle">Biography</h2>
               <p>Adi Shamir is an Israeli cryptographer and computer scientist, born July 6, 1952 in Tel Aviv. He is one
                   of the three cowinners of the Turing Award in 2002, won by Shamir, <a href="html/biographies/rivest.html">Rivest</a> and <a href="html/biographies/adleman.html">Adleman</a>. These three scientists
                   patented their “Cryptographic Communication System and Method” known as RSA encryption. Rights have been assigned
                   to MIT. He is the co-inventor of the Feige-Fiat-Shamir identification scheme and one of the inventors of differential
                   cryptoanalysis and has made numerous contributions to the fields of the cruptography and computer science.<br/>
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Career and Research</h2>
               <p>Shamir received his Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from Tel Avic University in 1973. Later he got a
                   Master of Science in 1975 as long as a Doctor Philosophy degree in 1977 at the Weizmann Institute in Computer Science. <br/>
                He began as researcher in the University of Warwick for a single year, moving then to MIT and finally going back
                Weizmann Institute in 1980. In 2006 is has been also invited in Paris.<br/>
                Along with inventing RSA, he also had different contributions with many different projects such as the Shamir secret
                scheme, the breaking of the Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem, visual cryptography, and the TWIRL and TWINKLE
                factoring devices. He also contributed by finding the first linear time algorithm for 2-satisfiability and showing
                the equivalence of the complexity classes PSPACE and IP. <br/>
                Shamir has also been elected to numerous Awards along with Turing’s, such as the Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice
                Award, the Erdős Prize, the IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award, the Israel Prize, the Japan Prize
                and many more.
