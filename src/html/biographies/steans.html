               <br>
               <p>Richard Edwin Stearns (Richard Edwin Stearns), born in Caldwell on July 5, 1936, American mathematician, won the ACM Turing Award in 1993 for laying the foundations in the field of computational complexity theory.
<br> Stearns laureated from Carleton College in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics.
<br> After completing his doctoral thesis in 1961, he earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University.
The title of this document is "Unsecured Three Party Cooperative Game".

Stearns, actually, is the distinguished emeritus professor of computer science at the University of Albany.

               <p>Stearns also worked with Hartmanis to take down the sequential machine.
                 <br>
These are simple computer models that can be broken down into a set of smaller sequential machines that perform the same task. His designs were collected in files and collected in a book in 1966.
