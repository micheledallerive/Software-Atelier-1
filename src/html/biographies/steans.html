                He won l'ACM Turing Award on 1993 for establishing the foundations for the field of computational complexity theory.
                <br>
Stearns graduated in a bachelor's,in mathematics, from Carleton College in 1958.
He other  earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1961 after completing a doctoral thesis.
<br>
This thesis was entitled "Three-Person Cooperative Games Without Collateral".

Stearns actually is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the University of Albany.

               <h2  class="subtitle" >Research</h2>
               <p>Stearns collaborated with Hartmanis on the decomposition of sequential machines.
                 <br>
                 These are models of simple computers can be decomposed into a set of smaller sequential machines that accomplish the same tasks.
                 TShis project were collected in papers and ,in 1966, were summarized in a book.
