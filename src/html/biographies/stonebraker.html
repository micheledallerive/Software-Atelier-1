               <p>Michael Ralph Stonebraker born in Milton, New Hampshire on October 11, 1943. 
                In 1965 he got a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering at Princeton University  and a Ph.D. 
                From the university of Michigan in 1967 and 1971.<br/>
                Due to the number of studies, experiments and creations he madhe became an extremely important computer 
                scientist specialized in database systems. <br/>
                Its central research were about relational databases managemene during its career t systems (RDBMS) funding 
                many database companies such as Ingres Corporation, Illustra, Paradigm4, StreamBase Systems, Tamr, 
                Vertica and VoltDB. 
               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Career and Research</h2>
               <p>By joining the University of California in 1971, for twenty-nine years he taught in the computer science 
                department but, most importantly, he was able to work on relational databases for the first time. <br/>
                He had multiple successes by earning different medals in Innovation Awards until he won its most important 
                one, the Turing Award in 2014. <br/>
                In 1997 he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering Developing and commercializing relational 
                and object-relational database systems. <br/>
                Stonebraker joined University of California, Berkeley as an assistant professor in 1971 and taught in the 
                computer science department for twenty-nine years. There he did his early pioneering work on relational 
                databases. In 1973, with some colleagues, began researching about relational database systems and started 
                a project called INGRES (interactive Graphics Retrieval System). In the mid-1970s the team, made of 
                colleagues and university students, produced a usable database system, much lighter than IBM’s System R, 
                which required much more power. Despite of being such a “low-end” product, their creation became much more 
                popular by taking advantage of its capabilities. <br/>
                The company founded from the Ingres project was called  Relational Technology, Inc. Later renamed Ingres 
                corporation. The company have been later sold to Computer Associates but became independent again in 2005 
                with the name changed into Actian. Ingres was also used as core for the company Sybase, which code was 
                used as a basis for Microsoft SQL Server. <br/>
                After founding its first company, Stonebraker, began the POSTGRES project which scope was to surpass 
                Ingres limitations by optimizing and improving capabilities and performances. Indeed, he added 
                Object-oriented programming, which uses objects, classes, subclasses (predefined modular units), 
                to make computer programming faster and easier to maintain, along with being more versatile. <br/>
                After that, he began the new project Mariposa, the basis for Cohera Corporation. Mariposa was built 
                with the intention of making a federated database over an economic model of resource trading. <br/>
                In 2001 Stonebraker started his career as professor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 
                and started multiple projects along with database companies based on his own new research. All the 
                projects he worked on were about database improvements and adaptations.  <br/>
                Such projects were Aurora, StreamBase, C-Store, Vertica, Morpheus, Goby, H-Store, VoltDB and SciDB.
