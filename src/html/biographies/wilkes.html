               <h2 class="subtitle">General</h2>
               <p>Sir Maurice Vincent Wilkes, as the title suggests, was a British computer scientist born
                 in 1913, in Dudley England. He is the second recipient of the Turing Award in 1967 for
                 building the EDASC, the first stored program computers.

               </p>
               <h2  class="subtitle" >Contributions</h2>
               <p>Wilkes University degree was in mathematics at St. John’s College in 1931 and later he got a
                 PhD in Physics which was revolving around radio propagation of extremely long radio waves in
                 the ionosphere.
                 <br>
                  In 1945 Wilkes became second director of the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory.
                  There he came into contact with John Von Neumann’s description of the EDVAC (succeeded the ENIAC).
                  After reading it Wilkes was sure he wanted to participate in the creation of such a machine.
                  Thus in the summer of 1946 Wilkes travelled to the US, to Moore’s School of Electrical Engineering,
                  where the EDVAC was being constructed.
                  <br>
                  Upon his return in England he immediately started working on sketching possible designs.
                  Wilkes eventually built a smaller and much slower model called EDSAC that operated fully from May
                  of 1949, 1 year before the completion of EDVAC. EDSAC was used to solve differential equations of gene
                  frequencies. It served as the first computer to be used in biology.
                  Besides his contribution with EDSAC, Wilkes was also the inventor of microprogramming, in 1951.
                  <br>
                  Microprogramming implemented the idea of controlling the CPU with a highly specialized computer program
                  of miniature size.
                  <br>
                  This was implemented on EDASC 2 and later on Titan which was built in 1963.
                  <br>
                  Lastly Wilkes also created the symbolic labels, subroutine libraries  and macros which essentially
                  created the concept of high-level programming languages.In later years he helped build a special computer
                  for Cambridge called Cambridge CAP.
                  <br>
                  During the 60’ Wilkes worked on timeshare systems, distributed computing and capability-based computing.
